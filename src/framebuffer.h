 * Size vs Length
 *
 * Size represent the effective size of audio/video buffer,

 * Until 1.1.0, there isn't such distinction, and 'size'
 * have approximatively a mixed meaning of above.
 *
 * In the long shot[1] (post-1.1.0) transcode will start
 * intelligently allocate frame buffers based on highest
 * request of all modules (core included) through filter
 * mangling pipeline. This will lead on circumstances on
 * which valid data into a buffer is less than buffer size:
 * think to demuxer->decoder transition or RGB24->YUV420.
 * 
 * There also are more specific cases like a full-YUV420P
 * pipeline with final conversion to RGB24 and raw output,
 * so we can have something like
 *
 * framebuffer size = sizeof(RGB24_frame)
 * after demuxer:
 *     frame length << frame size (compressed data)
 * after decoder:
 *     frame length < frame size (YUV420P smaller than RGB24)
 * in filtering:
 *      frame length < frame size (as above)
 * after encoding (in fact just colorspace transition):
 *     frame length == frame size (data becomes RGB24)
 * into muxer:
 *     frame length == frame size (as above)
 *
 * In all those cases having a distinct 'lenght' fields help
 * make things nicer and easier.

 * Transcode Framebuffer in a Nutshell (aka: how this code works)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Introduction:
 * -------------
 * This is a quick, terse overview of design principles beyond the
 * framebuffer and about the design of this code. Full-blown
 * documentation is avalaible under doc/.
 *
 * When reading framebuffer documentation/code, always take in mind
 * the thread layout of transcode:
 *
 * - import layer is supposed to run 2 threads concurrently
 * - filter layer is supposed to run 0..N threads concurrently
 * - export layer is supposed to run 1 thread
 *
 * So, in any transcode execution, framebuffer code is supposed to
 * serve from 3 to N+3 concurrent threads.
