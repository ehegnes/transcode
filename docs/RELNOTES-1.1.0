Introduction
============

The transcode team is pleased to announce the avalbility of transcode 1.1.0.
Transcode 1.1.0 is our new major release, that establishes a new milestone for
the project: we have started a massive reorganization of the code, aiming to
address some historical weakness of the project and to prepare land for next
major enhancements.
Despite the huge effort expended, 1.1.0 is a transitional release.
Most of the resources were employed to make the project foundations better, 
and a very few benefits surfaced so far; But our effort was fruitful, so
we are ready to develop some new exciting news for next releases. Expect
quicker and more interesting releases soon.


Overview
========

This section quickly outlines the changes between transcode 1.0.x and 1.1.0.
Every point remainds to a detailed description in the further sections.


(transcode) Command line reorganization
  Some options are renamed, some other are merged, a few others are removed,
  in order to make the command line more rational and consistent; online help
  (-h) layout was massively reorganized to improve readability.

(transcode) Module cleanup
  During 1.1.0 development cycle duplicated, obsolete or even broken modules
  were dropped to reduce the maintance burden without reducing the feature set.
  Some modules that duplicates the functionalities of the core ware removed as
  well, and core functionalities was enhanced.

(overall) Internal colorspace rationalization
  Usage of default colorspace (YUV420P) used internally in transcode is made
  consistent through core and modules. No more random usage of -k option,
  that is still of course avalabile, and no more blue people.

(transcode) Frame counter improvements
  ...

(tools) New output modes for tcprobe
  tcprobe features two now output modes: extended output (option -X) is more
  human-friendly and less cluttered; raw output (-R) is intended to be more stable
  in time and easier to parse for machines. Old output mode is of course still
  the default

(overall) **LOT** of bugfixes
  **ALL** bugfixes, and much more, applied to 1.0.x branch are of course
  applied as well on this release.

(transcode) new multiple input mode (**technology preview**)
  In the past releases, a few modules where capable to handle a directory as a source
  and join all file contained. This feature extend trasparently this capability to *all*
  modules, allowing the user to specify a collection of -of course, homogeneous- sources
  that will be intelligently join. This feature can be enabled using --multi_input mode,
  but is still a preview, only a few modules are supported. See transcode(1) for details.

(overall) new experimental modules (**technology preview**)
  As part of internal reorganization and rationalization (see below), a new, revised, improved
  architecture for writing transcode modules was introduced. New architecture (*NMS* in transcode
  jargon) allows to write more specialized modules, enhances their combinations and reduces
  code replication. A fair number of new modules are been written, and more are avalaible
  in CVS; those modules are fairly stable, but disabled by default to simplify things for the user.
  We expect to fully switch to new modules at least for export side for transcode 1.2.0.

(overall) better module introspection (**technology preview**)
  Another important benefit of new module architecture...

(modules) new modules
  - import_vag
  - import_pv3

(modules) improved modules [**DOCUMENTA OPZIONI MODULI!**]
  - import_mplayer
  - import_avi
  - filter_logo
  - all LZO-related modules
  - import_vob (nodemux)
  - import_ffmpeg (nopad)

(overall) massive architectural reorganization
  - aclib
  - libtc
  - libtcvideo
  - libtcaudio

(overall) growing testsuite
  foobar

(documentation) documentation improvements
  buzbaz

(documentation) Manpage revision
  WRITEME

(tools) more helper tools
  - tcexport
  - tcmodchain
