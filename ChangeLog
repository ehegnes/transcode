transcode-0.6.0 Thu Aug  2 00:20:07 CEST 2002

- This is 0.6.0 (final), fixes for rc4 provided by Tilmann Bitterberg.
	
- fixes for GCC-3.X compile problems with the new yuvdenoise filter.
	
- import_nuv fixes for directory mode.

- transcode manpage updates.
	
- obsolete debian build support directory removed.

------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0rc4 Tue Jul 30 21:13:00 CEST 2002
	
- last release candidate (rc4) for 0.6.0 (final).

- Experimental Ogg multimedia support added by Tilmann Bitterberg.
  This includes Ogg Vorbis audio encoding/decoding modules. 
  For more information on creating Ogg compliant media streams see 
  Moritz Bunkus' oggmtools:

  http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/ogmtools/ 

  Encode, e.g., to separate AVI XviD video / Ogg Vorbis audio stream with

  $ transcode [...]  -y xvid,ogg -m audio.ogg -o video.avi 

  and use oggmerge to multiplex into a n Ogg Multimedia stream. 
  Auto-probing is also available but no demuxing. 
  Decoding only for Ogg Vorbis single audio streams with the new import 
  module "import_ogg.so". 
	
- Dominique CARON <domi@LPM.univ-montp2.fr> updated the vob2divx.pl
  perl script in the contrib directory to v.0.9.9

- Patch by alex@foogod.com should fix most of not all of the issues with 
  auto-probing  LAV editlists.

- removed the PVM_HALFPELDIAMOND8 flag from the quality levels in the 
  XVID export modules family.

- first version of a YUV denoise filter by Tilmann Bitterberg.
  Read /docs/filter_yuvdenoise.txt for general and transcode
  specific information. Syntax is as usual:

  $ transcode [...] -q2 -J yuvdenoise=help:sharpen=100:mode=2
  
- Patch by Damian Ivereigh <damian@cisco.com> to fix a problem when trying 
  to get audio from AVI files when you refer to them just by the directory 
  name.

- Patches by alex@foogod.com for the MJPEG import filter, which will allow
  it to (correctly) read:

  1) Files with interlaced MJPEG fields
  2) Files with frames using YUV 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 representations.

  Among other things, this means that import_mjpeg can now read  interlaced 
  MJPEG files produced by lavrec (interlaced 4:2:2) directly. 

- Patch by alex@foogod.com for export_divx4.c 
  to make it work correctly with either DivX 4.x or 5.x encoder libraries. 
  Further development will focus on DivX 5.xx.

- bits per pixel info added by Tilmann Bitterberg.

- new import module "import_rawlist.so" to process a file list of raw video 
  frames. Simalr to "import_imlist.so" but only raw frames. You
  need to supply all video data on the command line. Untested.
	
------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0rc3 Thu Jul 11 22:19:11 CEST 2002

- this snapshot is the third release candidate (rc3) for 0.6.0 (final).
  Not much fixes but pending patches. 
	
- Dominique CARON <domi@LPM.univ-montp2.fr> updated the vob2divx.pl
  perl script in the contrib directory to v.0.8.3

- new audio filter "-J normalize" by Tilmann Bitterberg 
  <transcode@tibit.org>. 	 

- improved buffered reading/writing in the popen import sequence by 
  Tilmann Bitterberg.

- the preview window "-J preview" now closes typing "q" and 
  transcode continues to run, thanks to some patching by Tilmann.

- Moritz Bunkus <moritz@bunkus.org> conributed a Mplayer plugin for import. 
  This is mainly intended for severly broken sources, that otherwise
  fail to encode properly with transcode. There will be no autodetection
  of video and audio parameters. Untested.
	
------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0rc2 Thu Jun 20 22:15:12 CEST 2002

- this snapshot is the second release candidate (rc2) for 0.6.0 (final).
	
- applied Tilmanns fix for the NuppelVideo import bug.

- added the export_xvidraw.so module requested by Fabio Bizzi 
  <bizzi@albacom.net>. 

- header fix for export_wav.so by Tilmann.

- avisync fix for muting sound by Tilmann.

- ISO8601 date compliance fixed by Eduardo Perez <eperez@dei.inf.uc3m.es>

- fixed tcmplex to correctly detect and multiplex MP3 audio streams, which
  actually never worked before.

- import_v4l.so patched to support percents settings for the hue, contrast, 
  color and brightness settings in the file ~/.xawtv by Edouard Gomez 
  <ed.gomez@wanadoo.fr>.

- updates for Tilmann's "filter_logo.so" plug-in. Support for animated GIF
  added.

- finally fixed the --no_split / --psu_mode NTSC bug which caused a decoder 
  thread to restart on full frame buffer condition and messed 
  the encoding process. Thanks to Torsten Howard for the "Willow" donation
  to make the debugging possible.

- new option -c activated for tcmplex. Use "-c a-b" to multiplex a given
  time interval a-b in units of seconds only. This is very convenient for
  splitting VCD/(S)VCD/VOB into suitable chunks.

- fixes for import_nvrec.so keep up to date with latest NVrec tools, submitted
  by Tilmann.
	
------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0rc1 Wed Jun 12 22:16:18 CEST 2002

- this snapshot is the first release candidate (rc1) for 0.6.0 (final).
	
- Dominique CARON <domi@LPM.univ-montp2.fr> updated the vob2divx.pl
  perl script in the contrib directory to v. 0.7.0

- Arne Driescher <driescher@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de> updated
  the subrip program in the contrib/subrip directory.

- fixes for the odd cut filter behavior by Tilmann Bitterberg 
  <transcode@tibit.org>.	

- manpages updates by Tilmann Bitterberg.

- updates for "-J 32detect". The filter now accepts a couple of options:

   'threshold'  interlace detection threshold [10]
   'equal'      threshold for equal colors [10]
   'diff'       threshold for different colors [30]
   'force_mode' set internal force de-interlace flag with mode -I N [0]
                (currently only 1 and 3 are supported)
   'verbose'    show results [off]

  Example:
  transcode -i ~/d.vob -J 32detect=diff=30:force_mode=3

  The testframe generated with "-J testframe" gives a maximum of approx. 1000
  renormalized counts but a typical interlaced video frames gives much 
  less counts, therefore the default threshold is 10. The check is based 
  on pixels changing color going to neighbor row (diff), while having 
  almost equal color to next-neighbor row (equal) of same column.

- Tilmann added a color inversion filter "-J invert". Use "-J invert=help"
  to learn about options.

- applied a patch by Percy Jahn <jahn@kima.mv.ad.uni-kl.de> which
  adds some more parameters for the user profile. Untested.

----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre6-20020608 Sat Jun  8 23:43:09 CEST 2002

- fixes for import_xml.so by Marzio <Marzio.Malanchini@omnitelvodafone.it>.

- fixes for too small buffer arrays in various export modules.

- docu update for import_nvrec.so by Tilmann Bitterberg <transcode@tibit.org>.

- new long option "--encode_fields" to enable field based encoding in 
  export_xvidcvs.so.

- changes in the AV re-sync algorithm. Dropping/duplicating frames for "-M 2"
  should be much smoother now fixing the observed jerky motion on replay. 

- Tilmann Bitterberg <transcode@tibit.org> added some option string parsing 
  code for modules/filters. Quoting Tilman: 
  
  The string has to look like

  char opt[]="flag=1:range=100-200:sound=44100,16,2:file=foo.avi"
 
  The author of a module who wants to use this facility must only
  do the following

  #include "optstr.h"

  optstr_get(opt, "file",  "%[^:]",    infile);
  optstr_get(opt, "flag",  "%d",       &flag);
  optstr_get(opt, "range", "%d-%d",    &start, &end);
  optstr_get(opt, "sound", "%d,%d,%d", &freq,  &bits, &chan);

  If one would like only test if a string is specified

  if (optstr_get(opt, "flag", "") >= 0) ...

  I converted my filter modules to use these functions. With this
  i hope we will get options to import and export modules like

  -x ivmod=flag=1:range=0-100,iamod=...  

  Note: this is not implemented for modules yet.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre6-20020529 Wed May 29 23:18:46 CEST 2002

- updated included ffmpeg libavcodec to 0.4.6 (CVS).

- new export module "-y ffmpeg4" to encode with ffmpeg's fast
  MPEG-4 implementation contributed by Moritz Bunkus <moritz@bunkus.org>.

- fix for the -P2 bug by Tilmann Bitterberg <transcode@tibit.org>.

- various updates for "-x nvrec" by Tilmann Bitterberg.

- the configure script now searches for an installed libdvdread. If 
  you have already libdvdread installed, it is prefered, otherwise
  transcode falls back and uses the included copy. DVD navigation can be 
  disabled with configure option "--with-dvdread=no".

- new pass-through option -A for tcdemux. For example, if you want to
  reduce a VOB to audio track 1, video and maybe the first subtitle, run:

  tcdemux -i foo.vob -A 0xe0,0x81,0x20 > smaller_foo.vob

- export_toolame enhanced with a high-quality sox audio resampling filter by
  Cristian Vogelgsang <Vogelgsang@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>.

- Tilmann Bitterberg <transcode@tibit.org> introduced a dummy import
  module "auto". This module simply invokes the autoprobing of transcode
  for video/audio.This comes in place if you only want to force a audio import
  module and let video be probed, eg:

  transcode -i file -x auto,null ...

----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre6-20020524 Fri May 24 17:30:20 CEST 2002

- more fixes for avisplit by Tilmann Bitterberg and Chris C. Hoover.
  Special split mode with "-s 0" re-enabled.

- long option --psu_mode no longer takes an argument. This
  is now elegantly handled by option -o, thanks to Joern Reder and Jason Lunz.

- new long option --a52_dolby_off to disable dolby surround decoding.
  Required when using audio resampling based on bug report by 
  Christian Vogelgsang.

- small configure fixes. Disable X11 mods with "--disable-x".

- renamed export_mjpeg.c to export_ffmpeg.c to make it a general ffmpeg export
  API soon.

- new export module for encoding to fourcc MJPG with libjpeg by
  Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org> with "-y mjpeg". Not yet tested.
  The module is compiled if libjpeg is properly installed on your system.
  No -V and -Q options yet implemented.
	
- moved some general purpose routines for libioaux.

- new man pages contributed by Tilmann Bitterberg <transcode@tibit.org>.

- fixes for -q 0 (quiet) option by Tilmann Bitterberg.

- stdint.h now only included if HAVE_STDLIB_H also defined.
	
-------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5 Thu May 16 13:12:52 CEST 2002

- fixes for avisplit: absolute paths now working again. Enabled
  option "-c" to merge chunks generated by "-t" option on-the-fly.
  Infos printed on "-h" updated.

- ImageMagick now hopefully detected correctly.

- reorganized the off-line documentation in /docs/html/.

- patch for import_mov.c for a reported audio problem by Cristian Vogelgsang 
  <Vogelgsang@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>.

- updates for "-x nvrec" by Cristian Vogelgsang. Please read the documentation
  /docs/import_nvrec.txt for detailed changes.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020514 Tue May 14 16:05:03 CEST 2002

- fixed unwanted chapter looping for audio only processing.

- fix for broken "-T 1,-1" chapter looping in tccat.

- updated the off-line documentation in /docs.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020513 Mon May 13 08:56:28 CEST 2002

- fixed the stupid -E option check bug. However, the changing the audio bits 
  and channels with option parameters is not yet implemented.

- new core mode "--dir_mode" to work-around import modules
  that lack the "tccat" capability to process directory contents.
  This option enables avimerge functionality in addition with --no_split" for
  pass-through processing without merging first.

- small fix for af6_decore.cpp by Andreas Boman <aboman@nerdfest.org>.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020510 Fri May 10 13:43:06 CEST 2002

- VDR/MPEG directory mode enabled.

- fixes for encoding of chapter range with -T. Example: -T 1,2-5
  encodes chapters 2,3,4,5 and is now working without -U option.

- patch to fix option processing of -T by Kresimir Kukulj <madmax@iskon.hr>.

- more BSD fixes by Steven M. Schultz <sms@2BSD.COM>.

- liba52 dynamic range compression enabled by default. Switch it
  off with new long option --a52_drc_off

- new audio export module "-y pcm" for raw PCM data output. This
  module is only useful for demultiplexing multi-channel audio, e.g.,
  AC3/A52 in connection with required liba52. Demultiplexing is enabled with
  new long option --a52_demux and correct import channel number.

  Example: transcode [...] -e 48000,16,6 -y null,pcm --a52_demux -m track

  produces 6 files:
  track_c.pcm  track_l.pcm  track_lfe.pcm  track_ls.pcm  track_r.pcm  
  track_rs.pcm
	
  It is not checked, if the import source is suitable. YMMV.
  Note: this feature is currently not working!!!!

- Tilmann Bitterberg added a new import module to connect NVrec with
  transcode. Please read the documentation /docs/import_nvrec.txt
  for detailed information.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020506 Mon May  6 16:31:37 CEST 2002

- introducing pre/post processing slots for video processing.
  Currently only -j/-Y with equivalent long options --pre_clip/--post_clip
  is implemented.  
	
  (A) pre-processing (internal, fixed order, video only, single-threaded)
      Ex: --pre_clip (NEW!)

  (B) pre-processing (plug-ins, user defined order, single-threaded)
      Flag set: TC_PRE_S_PROCESS
      Ex: -J extsub, astat

  (C) pre-processing (plug-ins, user defined order, multi-threaded)
      Flag set: TC_PRE_M_PROCESS
      Ex: -J mask

  (D) main processing (internal, fixed order, multi-threaded)
      Ex: -j, -I, -B, ..., -C

  (E) post-processing (plug-ins, user defined order, multi-threaded)
      Flag set: TC_POST_M_PROCESS

  (F) post-processing (plug-ins, user defined order, single-threaded)
      Flag set: TC_POST_S_PROCESS
      Ex: -J extsub=0:0:0:0:1,preview

  (G) post-processing (internal, fixed order, video only, single-threaded)
      Ex: --post_clip (NEW!)

- changes for option -T to allow encoding of a chapter range.
  Example: -T 1,1-4 
  encodes DVD chapters 1,2 and 3 of DVD title 1. This extended option
  is fully backwards compatible, i.e, -T 1,2 encodes only chapter 2
  and -T 1,-1 concatenates all chapters before encoding. The option can also 
  be used to limit chapters for chapter (core-)mode with -U. 
  Extended options for -T also available for tccat.
	
- more infos with -q2 on path of loaded external MPEG-4 codecs.

- small --nav_seek bugfix by Jason Lunz.

- dvenc.c libdv-CVS related fix by Stefan Lucke. 

- tcprobe related bug reported by Moritz Bunkus with spaces in filenames fixed.

- check for lame.h in lame/lame.h to make it compile on RH7.2

- duplicated "extsub" filter to "extsub2". Currently this is the only
  way to add 2 subtitles at the same time in case someone ever needs this
  feature.

- typo in --record_v4l option fixed thanks to Yannick Calmes.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020503 Fri May  3 13:55:51 CEST 2002

- Andreas Neukoetter <anti@webhome.de> wrote a toolame export filter.    

- changes for avisplit by Chris C. Hoover <cchoover@charter.net>.
  The option -t is able to split an AVI-file based on time and frame 
  parameter. Here is an example:

  avisplit [...] -t ::.-12345,:.2-1:18.345

  does he following. It will split a first chunk starting at
  0 minutes, 0 seconds and 0 frames to 12345 frames. In addition, a second
  chunk covers 0 seconds and 2 frames to 1 minutes, 18 seconds and 345 frames.
  Sounds complicated but gives you full freedom to choose a chunk.
  Please note, for MPEG-4 AVI-files, the cut is made at a nearby keyframes.

  Another example for a single chunk:
  avisplit [...] -t -n:m:l.k 
  
  means 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds and 0 frames to n hours, m minutes, 
  l seconds and k frames. Any timecode is translated to frames based on the
  frame rate.
	
- a couple of "-q 0" related bugs fixed, thanks to a report by
  Thilo Mezger <thilo.mezger@web.de>.

- AVI-files with raw YV12/I420 codec now correctly processed.

- fixed the configure error on "--with-avifile-mods=no".

- added 1s delay on encoder closing in chapter/psu mode. The reported 
  segfault with --no_split has been fixed.

- proper parameter initialization in export_divx(4/5).so fixed
  by Christoph Lampert.
  
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020426 Fri Apr 26 09:12:41 CEST 2002

- this release does not fix any bugs or adds new features!

- changes in the configure.in. Upgraded my development platform to:
  autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.53
  libtoolize (GNU libtool) 1.4.2
  automake (GNU automake) 1.6.1

----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020425 Thu Apr 25 21:53:16 CEST 2002

- update for the contrib/vob2divx.pl script by
  CARON Dominique <domi@LPM.univ-montp2.fr>. Support for dvdrip added.

- experimental support for latest DivX 5.xx encoding available.
  The export module has been contributed by Christoph Lampert 
  <chl@math.uni-bonn.de>. If you want to make a transition to this
  new DivX binary only codec version please use "-y divx5". If you are not 
  planning to switch and want to stick to DivX 4.02, use "-y divx4" instead. 
  For both major version, the encoder binary is named "libdivxencore.so".
  The new module will not work with the older codec binary.
	
  In addition, the new module "export_divx5.so" now also generates a 
  logfile for 2-pass encoding using -R3 (fixed quantizer).

- fix for the giant bitrate problem and XviD encoding. The export module
  "-y xvid" should now work with latest official XviD codec release of
  2002-04-12.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020423 Tue Apr 23 21:35:44 CEST 2002

- new long option "--no_split" to enable 
	o DVD chapter mode "-U <base>" 
	o VOB program stream unit (psu) mode "--psu_mode <base>"
  to encode to a single outputfile, rather than splitting the
  output for each chapter/psu. Useful for 2-pass encoding.

- RGB mode extensions for 32drop/cshift/mask filter plugins and small
  bugfixes by Chad Page <cpage@silcom.com>.

- bugfix for the subrip program in contrib/subrip by Arne Driescher 
  <driescher@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de>.

- bugfix for audio only cluster mode bug introduced in last snapshots
  reported by Frank.Seidel@student.fh-nuernberg.de.

- fixes for MPEG VOB from DVB-C, that have a PTS every second packet only.
  Thanks to samples provided by Peter Bieringer <pb@bieringer.de>. 
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020419 Fri Apr 19 13:43:27 CEST 2002

- new long option "--cluster_chunks a-b" for convenient
  selection of a chunk range in addition to existing cluster encoding
  options. This is a mainly for (S)VCD/DVD cluster encoding. New
  option works for audio and video.

- new transcode core mode that is suitable for NTSC programs streams that
  show a high fragmentation due to program stream units (PSU). It seems
  that the PSUs, that are defined by a reset of the presentation time stamp 
  (PTS) require also a re-synchronization of audio and video.
  This is impossible in the current design of transcode. However, this new mode
  takes the navigation logfile with "--nav_seek <logfile>" and can be enabled
  by "--psu_mode <base>". Similar to DVD chapter mode, the import is 
  restarted at every PSU, thus taking a proper re-synchronization into account,
  whereas the audio encoding in continuous. The individual files can be 
  merged to one or more bigger chunks. If you only need to 
  encode a certain PSU range, use the additional new long option 
  "--psu_chunks a-b[,c]". The third parameter is a threshold, that avoids
  encoding units that contain less or equal c frames to skip junk units
  without messing AV synchronization. Default is c=12.

  Please note: 
     o experimental, not yet tested on a 2h movie.
     o this mode may show audible artifacts at the unit transitions.
     o it can only be used with "-x vob".
	
- new long option "--seek_nav <logfile>" to support fast seeking
  to a frame region with option -c using the navigation logfile produced 
  by "tcdemux -W". Patch contributed by Jason Lunz <lunz+mlist@falooley.org>.
  This option will only work in connection with "-x vob".
	
- CVS XviD module "export_xvidcvs.so" updated by Christoph Lampert 
  <chl@math.uni-bonn.de>.

- "import_divx.so" import module update to DivX 5.0 by Christoph Lampert.
	
- update for the subrip program in contrib/subrip by Arne Driescher 
  <driescher@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de>.

- fixes for the spec file by Michel Alexandre Salim <salimma1@yahoo.co.uk>.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020416 Tue Apr 16 22:20:01 CEST 2002

- more fixes for "avisplit" and "avisync" by Chris C. Hoover.

- transcode is now able to detect field/frame encoded MPEG sequences 
  and to adjust AV sync algorithm if necessary. This fixes also related
  subtitle timing problems.

- update for MPlayer libpostproc dependent filter plug-in by 
  Tilmann Bitterberg. If you need to work with MPlayer CVS, use
  the new "-J ppcvs". To obtain information on option parameter, 
  try "-J ppcvs=help". The default plugin "-J pp" is compliant with the 
  official MPlayer 0.60 libpostproc API.

- small bug for -D detected by Michael Stuermer <Michael.Stuermer@mallorn.de>.

- changes in the spec file by Michel Alexandre Salim <salimma1@yahoo.co.uk>.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020415 Mon Apr 15 09:39:42 CEST 2002

- Chris C. Hoover <cchoover@charter.net> has updated the "avisplit" tool
  and add new features.

- MP2 audio detection was broken in last snapshot - fixed.

- new import module for raw yuv picture import "-x yuv" by 
  Marek Blaszkowski <mb@intercon.pl>. No auto-detection for raw frames and
  directory mode for "-i" only. You must specify the frame parameter. 
  See import/yuv/Readme for details.

- changes to compile with libdv-0.9.5, if detected.

- preliminary fixes for subtitles and -V showing shadow effects due
  to chroma misalignement.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020410 Wed Apr 10 15:04:46 CEST 2002

- option -f now allows "0" if frame rate code is provided.
  Example: -f 0,1 sets framerate to 24000/1001=23.976024

- fixes for non-symmetric negative vertical cropping values. Now
  both options "-Y/-j" fully functional for positive and negative
  arguments.

- applied a patch contributed by Nicolas Vignal <nicolas.vignal@fnac.net>
  to make transcode work with filenames that include spaces.

- updates for filter_32drop.so by Chad Page <cpage@silcom.com>.

- bugfix for filter_xsharpen.so by Tilmann Bitterberg.	

- Chad Page <cpage@silcom.com> reintroduced mode "-F 6" for export_mpeg2enc.so   to support user specification of almost all mpeg2enc options.  
  This allows you to set up really good (but slow) encodes.               

- added "filter_logo.so" contributed by Tilmann Bitterberg. The filter
  needs ImageMagick installed. Get some usage help with "-J logo=help".

- new long option "--av_fine_ms t" for AV sync correction expressed in ms.
  t>0 will drop audio samples equivalent of t ms to change AV sync.
  t<0 will padd audio samples equivalent of t ms to change AV sync.
  note: t > 1./fps will be converted to -D option parameter to yield
  an effective t < 1./fps [ms].
	
- experimental support for new AV sync correction strategies "-M3/-M4"
  for automatic/manual AV fine-tuning down to 1ms.

  -M 3 (like -M 1) but invokes "-D/--av_fine_ms" options internally based
       on "tcprobe" PTS analysis.
  -M 4 (like -M 2) with additional frame rate enforcement (for NTSC). 

- added AVI-file index printout to tcscan.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020404 Thu Apr  4 10:10:49 CEST 2002

- new long option "--keep_asr" for smart resizing and keeping the aspect ratio
  introduced by Tilmann Bitterberg. This option requires also use of "-Z".

- updated the anti-alias routines to use integer arithmetic and lookup tables
  for minor speedups. New long option "--antialias_para w,b" to fine tune 
  processing. "w" (0<w<1) denotes center pixel weight (default=1/3) with
  respect to the 8 neigbours. "b" (0<w<1) determines relative x/y weight 
  (default=0.5). b=0 disables anti-aliasing in x-direction and b=1 disables 
  anti-aliasing in y-direction. Option -C is now thread-safe and fully
  working for all modes (1-3).

- new long option "--duration hh:mm:ss" introduced by Chris C. Hoover which
  limits grabbing from a v4l device.

- new long option "--no_audio_adjust" to disable periodically audio frames size
  adjustments for odd frame rates.

- added option parameter for "extsub" plugin to enable overlay on
  post-processing. This makes it possible to add black bars with "-j/-Y"
  before adding the subtitle and avoids fonts beeing messed by other frame
  processing routines. See "Examples" section on transcode homepage.
	
----------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre5-20020402 Tue Apr  2 22:45:16 CEST 2002
	
- changes in the AV sync mode in the MPEG demuxer. Removed drop sequence in
  favor of "-D" option, which seems to work better.

- new filter plugins added by Chad Page <cpage@silcom.com>. First and last 
  filter mostly for NTSC. Here is what he posted:
  
      o 32drop (no options) is like 32detect but drops frames and
	maintains an internal frame counter so that if interlaced frames are
        irregular the video will not fall out of sync more than 1 or 2 frames.

      o mask (mask=left:right:bottom:top, sorry that's not in the right
        order yet) is YUV only for now, and sets Y in the masked areas to 0 so
        that you can crop out unstable captured areas from VHS tape and make
        32drop work better.

      o chroma shifter (cshift=#) is another YUV-only filter shifts the
        chroma values by #, so that if your NTSC vhs cap has lagged colors
        (noticable here in animation) you can partially correct it. 
	I have found that black line areas maintain color information.

- Makefile in libsupport replaced by Juergen Hennerich 
  <s-hej4@jura.uni-tuebingen.de>.

- some unused network code removed.
	
- fix for an "assert" problem in ifo_read.c by eperez@dei.inf.uc3m.es.

- Altivec support added by Guillaume Morin <guillaume@morinfr.org>.

- small BSD fixes by Steven M. Schultz <sms@2BSD.COM>.

- small fixes for export_xvid(cvs).so by Christoph Lampert <chl@math.uni-bonn.de>.

- new long option "--record-v4l" for grabbing based on a time interval 
  in seconds as suggested by Chris C. Hoover <cchoover@charter.net>. 

- updates for filter_extsub.so.

------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4 Wed Mar 27 00:08:40 CET 2002

- fixes for the avifile import API provided by Christian Vogelgsang 
  <Vogelgsang@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>. His update also enables
  packed to planar 4:2:0 conversion if necessary and MainActor MJPEG codec
  is now fully working.
	
- fixes for interlaced MJPEG codec by MainActor for the native import support.
  In this case only one field is currently decoded.
  Example: let 720x576 be the frame dimension detected by tcprobe. You need
  transcode [...] -g 720x288 -k (-X 9,0 or -Z 720x576)
  to resize the field to a full frame.

- applied PPC patch contributed by Guillaume Morin <guillaume@morinfr.org>.
  
- bugfix for the NuppelVideo import module by
  Christian Vogelgsang <Vogelgsang@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>.

- forked the XviD export:
  
  o Use latest official snapshot 2002-03-17 with "-y xvid". 
  o If you follow CVS, please use "-y xvidcvs" instead.
	
- small update for export_xvidcvs.c by Edouard Gomez <ed.gomez@wanadoo.fr>.

- update for import_xml.so. Please see the documentation in 
  /docs/import_xml.txt provided by Marzio Malanchini on how to use this
  module.

- avimerge progress info finally available.

- added new export module "-y divx4raw". This will basically have all the
  features of "-y divx4" but will write a raw bitstream to the filename
  provided with "-o". You also need to supply "-m" if you want to obtain
  the raw audio stream with your format/codec of choice.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020324 Sun Mar 24 20:45:52 CET 2002

- updates for the MPEG export. The most important features are now documented
  and available both for PAL and NTSC. Please see
  http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/mpeg.html

  known issues:
  o mjpeg-tools and option --pulldown for 3:2 pulldown does not work
  o bbtools mpeg2 encoder for frame size 352x240 broken
  o tcmplex profile parameter "max_file_size" untested

  changes:
  profiles merged in "-y mpeg2enc", i.e., 
	-F 0    MPEG-1
        -F 1    standard VCD
	-F 2    user VCD
        -F 3    MPEG-2
	-F 4    standard (S)VCD
	-F 5    user (S)VCD
  support both PAL and NTSC depending on framerate. In addition, more options
  can be passed to "mpeg2enc" with a 2nd argument to "-F". However, for the
  standard profiles (1+4) parameters beyond specification are ignored.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020322 Fri Mar 22 14:31:08 CET 2002
	
- progress info added to avimerge by Joern Reder.

- patch by Jason Lunz <j@falooley.org> to lift frame size restriction if frame
  resizing is only applied to one dimension (-B/-X).

- Linux/Alpha patch broke bbmpeg. Fixed.

- tcmplex has a new option to alter default profile settings for video/audio 
  delay in ms. For example, the DVD profile "-m d" sometimes 
  requires "-D 0" to adjust AV sync.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020321 Thu Mar 21 20:23:49 CET 2002

- AV sync improvements for program streams.
	
- disabled auto-probing of AV shift for -M 1/2.
	
- quick bugfix release for the broken directory mode.
	
- title set number info added to tcprobe by Christian Vogelgsang.

- compilation problems, if no libxml2 present, hopefully solved.

- small scan_pes.c fix for not detecting MPEG video sequence headers.

- included the new filters that somehow got lost.

- vob2divx perl script updated by CARON Dominique <dcaron@LPM.univ-montp2.fr>
 	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020320 Wed Mar 20 20:17:40 CET 2002

- export_xvid.so updated by Edouard Gomez (alias GomGom) to support latest 
  official XviD codec snapshot of 2002-03-17 to be found here:
  <http://www.xvid.org/index.php?section=Download>

- improved AV sync for VDR MPEG videos.
	
- new import module "import_xml.so" to process xml tag files
  with further information on input files and frame range.
  The import module can manage dv and avi audio/video.
  This experimental module is contributed by Marzio Malanchini 
  <Marzio.Malanchini@omnitelvodafone.it>.

- frame range support for tcextract and AVI-files added by Marzio Malanchini.
  Use this feature with the new -C option. Currently, only
  the import_xml.so module makes use of it.
	
- patch by Nikita Schmidt <cetus@cnds.ucd.ie> to make transcode
  compile on Linux/Alpha. Untested.

- updates for the v4l import by Chris C. Hoover <cchoover@charter.net>.
  Two new long options have been added. Try "--more_help import_v4l"
  to learn about video grabbing.

- new filter plugins ported from VirtualDub to transcode by 
  Tilmann Bitterberg <bitterberg@gmx.de>:
  (1) A new de-interlace filter, see /docs/Smart for excessive documentation 
  in HTML format or use "-J smartdeinter=help".
  Tilmann did some testing of de-interlace filters of transcode
  You can view and read the result at <http://tibit.org/video/>.
  For more information see <http://sauron.mordor.net/dgraft/smart.html>
  (2) The filter "-J xsharpen" performs a subtle but useful sharpening effect,
  see the examples on the above mentioned page. Get some help
  on arguments with "-J xsharpen=help".
  For more information see <http://sauron.mordor.net/dgraft/xsharp.html>.

- changes in avimerge to enable simultaneous merging of multiple
  AVI-files and adding another audio track with "-p". Untested.

- small fix in /export/Makefile.am for libMagick support.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020312 Tue Mar 12 16:13:48 CET 2002

- fixed a small bug in filter_extsub.c where the audio import module was 
  accessed and caused problems with the null module.

- added -N option for tcmplex to switch to NTSC mode, default is PAL.
	
- applied a patch by Chris C. Hoover <cchoover@charter.net> to extend
  fixed profiles for NTSC available in "-y mpeg2enc". Untested.
  Note: This is only a temporary solution until the MPEG export port
        is fully tested for both PAL and NTSC.

   -F 11    //Standard VCD. An MPEG1 profile NTSC at 29.97
              //exactly to the VCD2.0 specification.

   -F 12    //Standard VCD. An MPEG1  profile NTSC at 23.976
              //exactly to the VCD2.0 specification.
 
   -F 13    //Standard VCD. An MPEG2 profile NTSC at 29.97
              //exactly to the SVCD2.0 specification.

   -F 14    //Standard VCD. An MPEG2 profile NTSC at 23.976
              //exactly to the SVCD2.0 specification.

- fixed a small bug in the new percentage based cluster mode.
  Use -W 100,100 for audio encoding.

- perls script vob2divx4.pl update in the /contrib directory by 
  CARON Dominique <domi@lpm.univ-monp2.fr>. he also contributed a cluster
  mode script "runclust".

- first set of expert options for divx encoding available via 
  --divx_quant and --divx_rc. Changes in export_xvid.c and export_divx4.c.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020310 Sun Mar 10 08:35:28 CET 2002

- fixes for NTSC cluster mode. The logfile generated by "tcdemux -W"
  is now independent of the framerate. 

- small long options update by Juergen Hennerich.

- new configure option "--enable-liba52" to make liba52 your
  default AC3/A52 decoder. You need the latest v0.7.3 to compile
  the decoder plugin. Default is libac3 decoding.

---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020306 Wed Mar  6 14:17:21 CET 2002

- added missing user donated scripts in the contrib directory.

- added INFO list to AVI file header. Currently the only entry
  is ISFT, which identifies the name of the software package used to
  create the file.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020305 Tue Mar  5 23:51:35 CET 2002

- inverse cropping "-j/-Y" extended for non-symmetric option
  parameter.
	
- updated Arne Driescher's /contrib/subrip/ subtitle processor

- applied a patch by Juergen Hennerich <s-hej4@jura.uni-tuebingen.de> 
  to make the long options work if not supported by the C-lib.

- some changes in the frame buffer structure for upcoming
  speed-ups. Eliminated a frame memcpy system call for -Z/-X.

- new percentage based cluster mode enabled with "--cluster_percentage".
  Contributed by by CARON Dominique <domi@lpm.univ-monp2.fr>. 
  This option switches the meaning of -W arguments. Example:
	-W A,B
  means: skip A percent and encode B percent. If you have a slow and a fast 
  machine you might want to try -W 0,20 for the slow and -W 20,80 for the 
  fast one. You need to take care of the numbers. Untested.

- added more user donated scripts in the contrib directory.

- added long option "--export_asr C" where C is a suitable
  aspect ratio code for the exported material. Used by encoders, that 
  do support this information, e.g., "-y mpeg".
  0=invalid, 1=1:1, 2=4:3, 3=16:9, 4=2.21:1 are common.

- the AC3/A52 decoding to A52_DOLBY has been enabled by a patch
  contributed by Joerg Sauer <js-mail@gmx.net>. According to his
  investigation, the resulting stereo audio has matrix encoded 
  surround channels. More user options coming soon.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020301 Fri Mar  1 23:04:59 CET 2002

- introducing the first long option "--zoom_filter"
  This option enables selection of a non-default filter for high-quality
  frame rescaling (zooming) in connection with -Z.

  Examples:  --zoom_filter L[anczos3]  (default, highest quality)
  
  others: M[itchell], B[_spline], T[riangle], H[ermite], bell, box. 

  The filter functions are defined in /src/zoom.c. Feel free to add
  your favorite filter here. The filters and methods differ in speed
  and image quality. 

- some LFS updates for the avilib directory.

- Tilmann Bitterberg <bitterberg@gmx.de> has contributed a patch
  to enable the inverse cropping "-j/-Y" for the horizontal frame 
  dimension also. This finally enables DV export PAL/NTSC at the
  required framesize without rescaling.

- added first version of a MJPEG export module. Encoding is done
  by ffmpeg. This is going to be a more general interface for ffmpeg
  supported codecs, however this version is hardcoded for MJPEG.
  I am not satisfied with the codec quality - this is alpha code.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020228 Thu Feb 28 22:50:36 CET 2002

- updates for "import_v4l.so" by Chris C. Hoover <cchoover@charter.net>
  to make the module process your $HOME/.xawtv file. 
  Select a TV channel with "-a 0,X" where X is the channel id in
  your ".xawtv" file. For example, "-a 0,E7" selects "ARD" in Germany, and
  "-a 0,-1" does not touch the current presettings.
  
- started to implement long options as suggested and prepared 
  by Juergen Hennerich <s-hej4@jura.uni-tuebingen.de>. Not used yet.

- added a first version of an ImageMagick export module "export_im.c".
  Export image codec and file format determined by "-F X". For example:
  "-y im -F tiff" writes a sequence of TIFF images, named 
  frame.000000.tiff, frame.000001.tiff, ...
  Currently, "-V" is slow, because of yuv2rgb conversion. Need to fix this.

- small bugfix for the subtitle plugin concerning the vertical shift option.
  Subtitles can be arbitrarily shifted up and down. 

- updated the subrip contribution to match latest subtitle header changes.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020227 Wed Feb 27 22:54:36 CET 2002

- small bugfix for fast vertical resizing -B/-X.
  Juergen Hennerich <s-hej4@jura.uni-tuebingen.de> contributed a patch
  that removed some of the frame parameter restriction of -B/-X. An
  optional 3rd parameter was added for -B/-X which must be a muliple of 8. 
  Default is 32 for backward compatibility. Examples:

  -B 1,1,8   reduces a PAL image to 712x568
  -B 2,0,16  reduces a PAL image to 704x576 and is equivalent to 
	     -B 1,0 or -B 4,0,8.

  Note that the frame dimension must be an integral multiple of the
  third parameter.

- configure option "--disable-x" will no longer build X11 dependent
  modules like "subtitler" and "preview".

- compilation problems with liba52 solved and a52_decore.c updated.
  You need libac52 v0.7.3 installed to make it work.
  Switch to liba52 decoding with audio import pseudo codec "-n 0x2001".

- small update for filter_testframe.so.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre4-20020226 Tue Feb 26 21:09:28 CET 2002

- some updates for NTSC program streams to improve AV sync.
	
- added a new import module for image processing "import_imlist.so".
  Same functionality as "import_im.so" except that it processes
  a list of images given as filenames with transcode "-i" option.
  All images must be same size and filetype. You must also provide
  image size and requested frame rate of your movie at the commandline.
  Example: 
  
  transcode -i image_list.txt -x imlist,null -g 352x288 -y divx4,null -f 1.0

  produces a slide show of one image per second. You can find out the frame 
  parameter (-g wxh) with tcprobe. 

- added a shell script for mpeg2divx conversion to the contrib directory by 
  Andreas Reichel <andreas.reichel@i-kit.de>.

- added a small audio plugin for audio only processing that skips audio 
  frames below a certain noise level. This may be useful
  for DVD's with tracks that have the film music only but long pausing
  during dialogs. Furthermore, a keyframe flag is set at every cut.
  Write to an AVI-file container with "-g 0x0" and null import/export
  video modules. Use avisplit and tcextract to obtain a set of
  audio clips at the end. Use this module with "-J aclip=a:b", where
  a is shreshhold (10) and b is the number of frames (25) that need to be
  below this threshold before frames are dropped.
	
------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3 Mon Feb 25 11:22:06 CET 2002

- DVD subtitles are now anti-aliased before rendering into
  the video frame. The option list for the filter plugin has been extended:
  
  -J extsub=s:h:t:f:a:b:p:q

  with:
        s   subtitle track id [0-31]
        h   offset of subtitle with bottom of frame 
        t   global display start time correction in msec
        f   fast rendering (no anti-aliasing) (0=off, 1=on)
        a   graylevel value a [0-255]
        b   graylevel value b [0-255]
        p   assign subtitle color p [0-3] to graylevel value a
        q   assign subtitle color q [0-3] to graylevel value b

  normally, subtitle color 0 is treated as transparent.
  Default is -J extsub=0:0:0:0:0:0 with p and q auto-detected.

- added a little audio filter plugin "-J astat" that will print the
  "-s" option parameter for volume rescaling (normalizing) on exit.

- Arne Driescher <driescher@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de> has contributed a
  subtitle ripper for the contrib/ directory. It uses transcode
  to rip the subtitle packets and converts them to images, which
  can be further converted to ASCI text and eventually be rendered
  with custom fonts and displayed by players, that support it.
  Please see README.subtitle2pgm for details.

- fixed another core bug on import side for multiple
  frame processing threads on a full frame buffer condition, leading
  to shutdown for failed buffer allocation.

- subtitler filter plugin updated to 0.6.3
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020221 Thu Feb 21 15:18:38 CET 2002

- more serious issues reported. Added a force exit flag for deadlock on
  transcode termination. Fixed transcode hangs on exit problem
  for full frame buffer or busy frame processing threads.

- new de-interlace option "-I 4". This option throws away a field,
  but unlike "-I 3", it does not zoom to full frame size again.

- added a missing option for SVCD encoding with "-y mpeg2enc -F 5" reported by
  Chad Page <cpage@silcom.com>.

- the audio resample filter now does the resampling, i.e.,
  "-J resample" forces transcode to use this re-sample filter instead
  of the export re-sample routines (lame/ffmpeg/mp2enc). Untested.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020220 Wed Feb 20 21:05:21 CET 2002

- one more snapshot before pre3, beacuse of broken tcdemux logfile 
  output with option -W for cluster-mode. Fixed, hopefully.

- NuppelVideo import was broken. Fixed it by duplicating
  decoder code to make it work for audio and video in parallel.
  No cleanup yet. 

- added an audio resampling filter plugin. Use it with
  "-J resample" and specify output sampling rate with -E. Do not use this
  plugin with export modules, that already have an internal re-sampling
  capability. The code has been taken from the NuppelVideo import module
  goes back to sox code. Use this plugin for PCM audio output.
  
- Yannick Vignon <ye.vignon@enst-bretagne.fr> added an export module for 
  another MPEG-4 codec, part of the libfame library. 
  Libfame (you need CVS) can be found on sourceforge:  
  "http://sourceforge.net/projects/fame".
  Use it with "-y fame", options similar to OpenDivX.

- fixed the DVD chapter looping audio only transcoding with "-p".

- applied a patch by Charles Wilson <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu> to enable
  build of transcode outside source directory.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020218 Mon Feb 18 13:11:21 CET 2002

- AC3 pass-through now works on a per frame basis, i.e.,
  AVI-file chunks contain integral number of AC3-frames, usually 1-2.

- frame reduction option "-r" now accepts 2 arguments for
  independent rescaling of height and width. As usual,
  "-r 2" corresponds to "-r 2,2". Use "1" for no change, i.e.,
  "-r 2,1" will only keep every 2 row, columns unchanged.

- changes in the internal subtitle header structure, thanks
  to suggestion by Arne Driescher <driescher@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de>.

- a small perl script for automatic audio rescaling/re-encoding of
  AVI-files was added in the contrib directory by
  Steffen Klupsch <steffen@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>.

- DVD subtitle support for NTSC enabled. Extended arguments for
	-J extsub="s:h:t:a:b"
  "t" will add a constant shift in milliseconds to the beginning of
  the subtitle display. Subtitles may lag a little behind. 
  "a","b" changes color parameter (not color). There are 4 "colors" (0-3)
  available. More infos on that soon.
	
- audio export info messages for MPEG layer-II request cleanup up.

- no channel selection for -a 0,-1 to enable recording from
  currently active channel set by, e.g., xawtv.
  Fixed problem to set grabbing frame size with -g.

- audio export with "-y *,mp2enc" now allows setting export bitrate
  and sampling rate. As a consequence, for VCD compliant audio 
  the options "-E 44100 -b 224" are now mandatory.

- enabled audio re-sampling for "-y mpeg", which was not activated and
  causes slowing down of audio for sample rates not equal the input
  sample rate.

- transcode server thread now only started in connection with "-y net".
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020214 Thu Feb 14 15:15:01 CET 2002

- transcode option -f expanded to provide the frame rate code information
  for improved precision. The frame rate code overwrites the first parameter.
  Use "-f 0,1" for setting the frame rate to 24000/1001.  

- changed AVI-header (strh) size from 64 to 56 bytes to avoid 
  "aviplay" complaining. Maybe this fixes also "kino" problems.

- wait for termination of frame processing threads before buffer
  release re-enabled.

- export_ppm.so now exports grayscale images along with option "-K"
  and suffix "pgm" for use with "pgmfindclip" written by Christian Vogelgsang.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020213 Wed Feb 13 14:16:46 CET 2002
	
- mostly core cleanups for upcoming pre3. Proper locking when
  issuing a signal for a condition variable. This may fix
  the Negative buffer counter problem. 

- removed debugging code in avimerge.

- fixed a small bug in probe.c detected by Christoph Lampert.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020211 Mon Feb 11 12:18:43 CET 2002

- bugfix for subtitle plugin buffer release notification.

- more core changes, cleaner frame processing thread termination, bugfix.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020209 Sat Feb  9 18:49:03 CET 2002

- some core cleanup for encoding/decoding. Cleaner handling
  of buffer requests and queuing. Negative buffer indicator problem 
  still unresolved.

- added import audio bitrate display.

- patch for "-x v4l" to enable grabbing in YUV mode, thanks to a patch
  by Tilmann Bitterberg <tilmann@bitterberg.de>. 
  Watch and record from TV with an ultra-fast de-interlace filter

  Example:
  transcode -i /dev/video -p /dev/dsp -V -y xvid -o q.avi -a 0,5 
	    -g 400x300 -H 0 -x v4l -u 100 -J pp=lb,preview

  Replace the frame size by values supported by your hardware for real-time
  encoding. Auto-probing for v4l still broken. 
	
- !!Alpha!! code for DVD subtitle support enabled. Subtitles are added with

  -J extsub="n:s"

  where "n" is the subtitle stream number (0-31) and "s" denotes a vertical 
  shift in the subtitle position. Default is "0:0", which places the subtitle 
  lined up with the bottom of the frame, usually filled with a black bar.
  Currently, this feature works only with import module "-x vob", i.e., not 
  with direct DVD transcoding. It's also only tested with PAL, NTSC may 
  not work, maybe only if -M1 also works for you.  
  This module is only for direct rendering the subtitle onto the video
  frame. Other methods will be added in the near future.
  
  KNOWN BUGS: 
  o A reset of the PTS within the stream will break the subtitles.
  o You need to figure out yourself, what subtitles are available.
    Use "tcprobe -i my.vob -H N" with N=10-20 to detect the total number 
    of subtitles within the stream.
  o If you do not start with the very first VOB chunks, it may take
    some time before the first subtitle is displayed.

- added custom mode (pseudo profile) "6" for "-y mpeg2enc" to use with
  -F "6,<string>"
  where string is directly passed to "mpeg2enc". This mode was suggested
  by <Marzio.Malanchini@omnitelvodafone.it>.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020206 Wed Feb  6 15:15:12 CET 2002

- fixed v4l configure/build bug.

- minor cleanup in export_mp2enc.c, -E disabled by default.

- added synchronous filter pre/post processing. Some filter
  simply are unable to run in parallel.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020205 Tue Feb  5 10:21:46 CET 2002

- quick bugfix release
	
- fix for broken "-F" option in export_mpeg.c.

- patch for streaming wav by Andrew Maltsev <am@amsoft.ru>.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020204 Mon Feb  4 10:53:16 CET 2002

- updates for MPEG encoding / NTSC framerate precision by Gerhard Monzel
  based on suggestions and patches from the ML.

- configure changes ImageMagick related suggested by Markus Plail, but
  the problems are most likely due to a broken "Magick-config".

- export to Quicktime movies improved by Christian Vogelgsang.
  Use it with "-y mov". It replaces the old Quicktime export modules "qt,mov".
  All codecs by the quicktime4linux library are enabled with option 
  string for -F. Examples:
            -F "mjpa,ima4" (default) 
  The IMA4 compressor reduces 16 bit audio data to 1/4 size, with very 
  good quality and MJPA stores each frame as two JPEGs interlaced.
  Thanks to Christian for completing the quicktime4linux import/export
  capabilities of transcode.
	
- fatal bug in avisync corrected.

- new audio only export module interface to mjpegtools mp2enc program 
  contributed by Georg Ludwig <email@georg-ludwig.de>. 
  This is the companion module for MPEG video encoding with mpeg2enc, so
  you probably use it with "-y mpeg2enc,mp2enc".
  I have added the capability to pipe the audio stream through sox for
  resampling. Use this feature with "-E". Untested.

- new import module "-x v4l". This module enables very primitive
  audio and video grabbing form a video4linux device. Added this
  for my personal pleasure and to make use of my old vcr-like 
  grabbing code, probably based on the great xawtv program.
  It enables realtime encoding to divx/mp3 at 352x288
  resolution and 25fps on my CII533@800. Do not use this experimental module.
  Currently works only in RGB mode. Examples:

  (1) record MPEG audio stream from /dev/dsp at (48000Hz,16bits,2ch)
  transcode -p /dev/dsp -y null,raw -o sound.mp3

  (2) record TV show (PAL), grabbing is at 360x288, but encoder needs 352x288,
      from preset station 2:
  transcode -i /dev/video -p /dev/dsp -a 0,2 -j 0,4 -y xvid -o show.avi

- DV type-1 AVI-files supported for import via directory mode
  of option "-i". No auto-probing available. You need to switch it off 
  completely with "-H 0" and provide video/audio parameter.
  Alternatively, extract the raw DV stream with "tccat" providing
  the directory name as input.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020130 Wed Jan 30 09:51:31 CET 2002

- patch applied to avisync for quiet operation donated by
  Tilmann Bitterberg.

- import_mov.so has been improved by 
  Christian Vogelgsang <Vogelgsang@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>.

- QuickeTime files are now processed by tcprobe. However, only
  a few codecs are actually supported.

- avimerge bug for multiple audio tracks has been fixed.

- patches by Vladimir Kushnir <vkushnir@alfacom.net> applied to
  make transcode compile and work on FreeBSD.

- audio pass-through mode has been fixed.

- import divx speedup for pass-through mode.

- pass-through mode now allocates 50 frame buffer. Overwrite with -u.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre3-20020126 Sat Jan 26 16:23:04 CET 2002

- added some README files to the /docs directory, based
  on the first week of mailing list discussion.

- inverse vertical cropping enabled for -j (pre-processing).	

- changes in tcdemux option -S default configuration. Streaming
  is started at unit N for -S N and all following units, if no
  (finite) sequence intervall is provided. This change was necessary, because
  trancodes chooses start unit on tcprobe recommendation.
	
- zero byte video frame size enabled for fast audio track encoding.

- added multiple audio track feature to transcode's avilib code. 
  However, adding more audio tracks to an AVI file has to be done separately.
  transcode supports reading from multi-track AVI-files but output is
  single audio. "avimerge" has a new option -p to add an additional
  audio track to an existing AVI-file. This feature has been requested
  frequently. Thanks to Rainer Lay for providing me a sample.

  Example: first session gives you movie.avi with a single audio track.

  second session:
	
  (1) transcode the second audio track into an AVI container file:
  For a VOB stream, this looks like:
	
  transcode -i (...) -x null,vob -g 0x0 -y raw -a 1 -o add-on.avi	
  	
  The resulting file is only a temporary file. Replace "vob" if you encode
  from DVD. Video import module set to null. If all goes well, 
  both files should be identical with respect to the number of frames. 
  Choose the proper audio track etc.

  (2) merge this track into movie.avi

  avimerge -i movie.avi -o dualaudiomovie.avi -p add-on.avi 	
  
- updated /tools and various other files to support the new multiple audio 
  track feature. 

- minor fixes in /bbmpeg by Gerhard Monzel.

- minor fix for import_im.c.

- improved NTSC frame rate detection based on tff/rff flags.

------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre2 Tue Jan 22 10:38:14 CET 2002

- final pre-release #2. Issues not fixed must wait for pre3.
	
- Christoph Lampert <chl@math.uni-bonn.de> updated the export to XviD.
  You need to install a recent snapshot of the OpenSource XviD codec.
  The codec file loaded at runtime has been renamed to "libxvidcore.so".

- added rgb2yuv conversion to export with "mpeg,mpeg2enc,yuv4mpeg", in case
  the decoder (import) is unable to decode to YV12/I420.

- updated export_mpeg2enc.c to use the new mjpegtools stream header IO API.

- fixed a problem with avifile stdout pollution by loading avifile code
  only on demand.

- updated "avisync", decided to keep it for awhile. Recycled old frames
  as padding frames for proper timing. Good for small delays, but makes 
  no sense for large delay. You need to cut afterwards.
	
- post-processing option -Y now allows for adding symmetrical black bars 
  on top and bottom of video frame (inverse cropping). Based to a 
  suggestion by Julio Sanchez Fernandez.
	
- more Makefile fixes by Steven M. Schultz.

- more Manual-pages added by Dirk Gouders.
	
- subtitler filter plugin updated to 0.6.

- expanded volume gain option "-s" for AC3 down-mixing provided by
  German Gomez Garcia <german@piraos.com>. 

	-s gain,center,front,rear

  gain is an overall scaling factor applied to both stereo channels.	
  The rest of options are only valid for AC3 streams, they are
  used while down-mixing several channels into stereo sound. The
  most common use is to amplify the center channel used for voice,
  a value of 3.0 is usually right for most common movies with high
  density of sound effects that make people whisper. Anyway
  experiment with different values and see for yourself.
  All four option parameter are positive floats. Import modules "ac3,dvd,vob"
  updated.

- import module "-x lav" updated to work with directories containing
  multiple streams.

- AVI file header updated (written to disk), whenever video/audio 
  parameter are set. If transcode or hardware crashes, the truncated file 
  is in most cases playable for advanced players. 
  Repairing the file is also possible via pass-through option "-P3".
  Example:  "transcode -i crashed.avi -o new.avi -P3 -u X"
  Option "-u X" with X>>10 enhances pass-through speed.

- more fixes for the cluster option "-W". 

- option "-H n" now takes an argument. It is passed to tcprobe and
  determines the amount of MB seeked into the source file for auto-probing.

---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre2-20020115 Tue Jan 15 23:27:16 CET 2002

- this snapshot adds a couple of new features:
	
- a manpage for transcode has been contributed. Thanks to
  Dirk Gouders <gouders@et.bocholt.fh-ge.de>.

- port to BSD/OS 4.3, thanks to a patch by Steven M. Schultz <sms@2BSD.COM>.
  Untested.
	
- fixed a bug for the cluster mode -W were a frame was missing at
  certain chunks, thanks to a report by Henning Weber.
	
- changed tccat option -P default behavior. A complete DVD title can
  be streamed for backup purpose. Note the essential differences between
  "-T" and "-P":

  "-T N,-1,A" streams the title N starting with chapter 1 and so on for
  a single viewing angle A. The resulting file/stream can be viewed by a player
  or is used for transcode's single file / directory mode with option "-i". 
  DVD navigation with the stream is no longer possible. To stream only a single
  chapter M, use "-T N,M,A".
	
  "-P N" streams the complete set of VOB files from the DVD for the selected
  title including mulitple angle scenes and navigation packs on a per 2kB 
  sector basis. Copy the IFO files by hand and the stream/files can be used for
  DVD navigation, provided proper renaming. Chapter and Angle parameter do not
  make any sense here. A progress meter is also available.
	
- added the "-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE" compiler option.
	
- updates for "import_vdrac3.so". The hack enables reading of incorrect
  AC3 packets with useless track ids in VDR streams for transcode.

- Gerhard Monzel added export module "export_mpeg2enc.so", based on a 
  suggestion by Andrew Stevens <andrew.stevens@nexgo.de> to enable
  use of mjpegtools MPEG/(S)VCD encoding capabilty. This requires
  the new mjpegtools-1.6.0 installed on your system. 
  Currently, predefined profiles are passed to the module via -F n.
  Check the mpeg2enc manpage for the corresponding option "-f".
  In addition, use "-b" for the encoder maximium bitrate and let transcode
  do the resizing. Only PAL for now.
  
   "-F n" supported profiles:
	
      0 = Generic MPEG-1 (default)
      1 = Standard VCD. An MPEG1 profile exactly to the VCD2.0 specification.
      2 = User VCD. 
      3 = Generic MPEG-2
      4 = Standard SVCD. An MPEG-2 profile exactly to the SVCD2.0 specification
      5 = User SVCD.
      6-8 yet unsupported.
	
  Note: (1) and (4) have predefined bitrates and option -b has no effect.
	
- changes for the audio MP3 encoding option "-b". Third argument is passed
  to the lame library for setting the encoding quality=[0-9] with 
  0=best (very slow) up to 9=worst, the default is 5.

- added native support for AVI-files with MJPG video codec. Decoding is done
  via ffmpeg. If auto-detections fails, use "-x mjpeg".
	
- updated divx import module "-x divx". Now supported is 
  pass-through mode with the capability to detect intra (key) frames. 

  Example 1: remux old DivX;-) AVI-file with interleaved MP3 audio

  transcode -i old.avi -P 3 -x divx,avi -y raw -o new.avi

  Example 2: audio transcode old DivX;-) AVI-file with non-interleaved 
             MP3 audio

  transcode -i old.avi -P 1 -x divx,mp3 -y raw -o new.avi       

  the resulting files are suitable for avisplit. 
  Fixed the bug that prevented re-export to DivX.
	
- small changes in avisplit. Added option "-o base" to choose a basename for
  splitting to base-%04d.avi instead of in_file-%04d (optional).
  Using -s 0 will now dechunk the AVI file into the smallest available
  units based on the keyframe info. Each chunk has only a single keyframe.
	
- transcode's progress meter now thread safe.

---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre2-20020112 Sat Jan 12 21:16:47 CET 2002

- Gerhard Monzel updated the bbmpeg directory and also
  the export to MPEG with "-y mpeg". This hopefully fixes
  a segfault after 11 frames with (S)VCD export "-F s".

- added divx import module "-x divx". Currently, this
  module requires the DivX 4.xx codec "libdivxdecore.so" installed on your 
  system. The module does not work with divx re-export for yet unknown
  reasons, but MPEG/PPM export should be fine.

- added import module "import_vdrac3.so" for certain digital video
  capture cards producing incorrect AC3 packets (track 1) in addition to
  MP2 audio track 0.
  No autoprobing yet, usage example (relevant parameter in bracket)
  "transcode (-x vob,vdrac3 -H -M 0 -a 1) -i ... -y ... -o ..."
	
- DVD subtitle packets can be now be ripped with tcextract.
  Example: "tcextract -x ps1 -t vob -a 0x20 -i file.vob"
  dumps subtitle id=0 packets encapsulated in private stream 1 (-x ps1)
  to stdout. Subtitles id's range from 0x20-0x3F. Check with tcprobe,
  if your stream comes with subtitle. Hopefully, someone will
  write a filter plugin for DVD subtitles.

- Andrew Stevens <andrew.stevens@nexgo.de> (mjpegtools) has contributed
  a patch to make the export_yuvmpeg.so module (-y yuv4mpeg) use the new
  YUV4MPEG2 header. You must have mjpegtools-1.6.0 installed.
	
- added quicktime export module for RGB/YV12 raw video and 
  PCM audio "-y mov". This module is only useful, if you
  plan some post-processing with Broadcast or encoding with
  RealProducer under linux. Currently xmovie plays the files, but the
  sound is broken and Broadcast does not recognize the file.
  STATUS: unusable - for developers only.
	
- added quicktime import module for RGB/YV12 raw video and 
  PCM audio "-x mov". Not yet tested. STATUS: unusable - for developers only.

- minor fixes in tcscan.

- minor fixes in import_yuvmpeg.c.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre2-20020107 Mon Jan  7 17:57:37 CET 2002

- some configure.in changes.

- fixed another tcprobe bug with DVD bitrate calculation.

- preliminary openquicktime support (configure only, no modules yet).

- ImageMagick interface added by Gregory Brauer <greg@wildbrain.com>
  and Philipp Zerelles <philipp@moongate.de>.
  The import module is invoked by "-x im" and transcode needs
  the first image of the sequence with option "-i". 
  Currently, the frame display time (default is 1 fps) is a constant for 
  all frames.

- fixed hardcoded "libdvdcss" access in dvd_reader.c, thanks to a hint by
  Steffen Kremser.

- new direct streaming option "-P N" for tccat, to linearly rip a complete
  single angle DVD title. 

- new option "-S n" for tccat, to seek to file offset n*2kB for VOB streams.
  Works also for directory mode. This option is mainly used by transcode
  for cluster encoding.

- support for cluster batch encoding with transcode's new options "-L" and "-W"
  for VOB processing. For more information, see the related documentation
  on the transcode homepage or the file cluster-guide.txt in the /docs 
  directory. Patch from Joern Reder applied.

- Gerhard Monzel added filter plugin interface to MPlayer postprocessing 
  routines. Use this filter with "-J pp". You need to specify the MPlayer build
  directory with "--with-libpostproc-builddir" to enable compilation of
  the plugin. See MPlayer for module options. For example, a high quality
  de-interlace routine is available with "-J pp=lb".
	
- skip MMX filter on non-MMX machines.

- some updates for MPEG encoding with "-y mpeg" by Gerhard Monzel.
  Some documentation for user profile parameter has been added, see
  file template.cfg.doc. 
	
- some info updates in tcscan for program streams.

- the subtitler filter plugin has been updated to 0.5.7.
	
- removed the old libmpeg directory, only CVS code available now.
	
---------------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre2-20011223 Sun Dec 23 18:52:59 CET 2001

- pre-release development snapshot (some features unfinished)
 	
- fixed tcprobe problem with data initialization for gcc-2.96.

- fixed zero byte bogus write error in decode.c/aud_aux.c, which
  broke a couple of things both on import and export.

- fixed broken yuv4mpeg import.
        
- fixed core bug in connection with "-M 2" "-x dvd" and "-y ppm" and "-c"
  parameter combination.

- fixed missing MP2 codec handling in "-x vob" and "-x dvd".
        
- fixed AC3 frame auto-probing issue related to incorrect probing of
  truncated packs. 

- changes in the auto-probing. tcprobe now resets collected information
  in program streams if a reset of the SCR (system clock reference) is 
  detected. Example: There may be a few seconds of junk without audio 
  prepended to the main presentation. This information is passed to transcode
  via the "-S" option. If you encounter a problem with this change, overwrite
  it at the command-line with "-S 0" to establish the old (<0.5.3) behavior.
  This should improve trancoding of NTSC sources. Direct DVD probing is 
  not affected, since IFO files are read.

- added option "-H n" for tcprobe for increasing the default the search 
  range for audio and video tracks. Default is 1 MB (n=1), suggested 
  by Christoph Lampert. 

- added "-V" capability to PPM export module, i.e., yuv2rgb conversion.

- added preview filter plugin "-J preview=Y", where Y={xv,gtk,sdl}
  to take a look at the export picture before encoding.
  Code borrowed from libdv.

- added filter "-J dixvkey" that scans divx frames for encoding parameters,
  mostly to detect keyframes for pass-through mode, not working yet.
	
- new import module "-x tiff" for reading sequences of (identical) tiff files
  and making nice animations. 
  Contributed by Philipp Zerelles <philipp@matrix-computer.com> 

- new import module for reading the lav format of mjpegtools.
  Contributed by German Gomez Garcia <german@piraos.com>. 
	
------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.6.0pre1 Fri Dec 14 15:17:12 CET 2001

- development branch with major feature enhancements:

  NOTE: new features are highly experimental
  and may not work as advertised, but in most cases the 
  results are promising and usable.

  What's new in 0.6.0pre1:
	
- Gerhard Monzel finally added a module for transcoding to MPEG-1/2. 
  Included are the sources of his port of bbmpeg to linux.
  This code is still under development but usable. Use with "-y mpeg"
  and option string provided with "-F":
   
  Option "-F" is analyzed as follows:
  -F "<base-profile>,<resizer-mode>,<filename of user-profile>" 
  with
	base-profile:   1 = mpeg1 vbr, buffer 46Kb (*** default XVCD)
                        b = mpeg1 vbr, buffer 224Kb (experimental)
                        2 = mpeg2 vbr
                        d = DVD
                        s = SVCD
                        v = VCD
        resizer-mode:   0 = no resizing
                        1 = resizing to 352x288
                        2 = resizing to 480x480
                        3 = resizing to 480x576
  filename of user-profile: see ./bbmpeg/template.cfg for details

  Option -o name produces two files:
  1) name.m1v or name name.m2v depending on the base-profile
  2) name.mpa MP2 audio stream
  The raw streams can be multiplexed with the new tool "tcmplex" which
  is merely a frontend to mplex code based on original work of Christoph Moar.
  Additional documentation will be provided by Gerhard. 
  You need "nasm" installed to compile the libraries.
  Currently, only PAL frame rate supported.
	
- added the encoder/decoder core library of ffmpeg-0.4.5 by Gerard Lantau. 
  Currently, this is only used to provide MP2 audio streams with "-y mpeg".

- transcode core changes:
  import of audio and video is now decoupled with independent threads 
  and buffers. This move prevents a deadlock with the new net stream
  features. Note: breaks the 0.5.x filter interface.
  Status: Almost working with no problems. 

- transcode progress bar now displays information on the internal video buffer
  status like for example "(10,2,0)".
  This means, 10 frames are loaded in the buffer chain, 2 frames are currently
  locked by the frame processing threads and no frame is waiting for the
  encoder. In most cases, all frames are queued in the encoder waiting room, 
  i.e., "(0,0,12)". The sum of all different buffer numbers should be a 
  constant. Play around with option "-u" to fine-tune transcode.

- added "net" import/export modules. What is it good for? 
  The export module "-y net" writes raw video and audio frames on host A 
  to network sockets, instead of calling the encoder. Unless a transcode 
  instance reads from this sockets, the process is waiting. Start transcode 
  on host B with "-i A -x net" to read the raw streams over the network.
  Use "tcprobe -i A" to query host A for details of the raw stream.
  Now, host B might be used for further frame processing. Use "-y net"
  to pipe the streams to the network sockets on host B and start transcode
  on host C to pick up the streams for encoding. 
  Note: Unless you have a high-speed network connection, this feature
  is totally useless due to the amount of raw data. However, if frame 
  processing is consuming most of your time and you do not want to split
  encoding the basic way, you are able to chain an arbitrary number of
  transcode instances on a cluster. Status: Highly experimental.

- added a daemon thread that communicates with tcprobe.
	
--------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.2 Fri Dec 14 11:22:30 CET 2001

- minor bugfixes and feature enhancements:

- added a filter "filter_testframe.so" module for developers and
  debugging. This plugin module generates alternating pattern of black and 
  white rows (mode=0) or vertical columns (mode=1). Useful for testing frame 
  resizing/deinterlacing routines.

- preliminary bugfix for the fast horizontal frame resize routine. 

- support for the new mjpeg-tools YUV4MPEG2 stream header format for import
  thanks to a hint by Tomi Ollila.

- fixed a bug with odd file permission in export_yuv4mpeg.c.

- fixed a bug in dvd_reader.c, where wrong title IFO files were selected.
	
- raw DV to AVI type2 conversion via pass-through mode "-P 1" added.
  Restriction: The stream has to be detected properly as a DV stream.

- improved DV auto-detection.

- auto-detection now distinguishes between MP3 and MP2 audio.
	
- subtitler (filter) plugin upgraded to version 0.4.

- added plain WAVE audio export module for PCM sound "-y wav".

- lame vbr encoding mode set as second argument to "-b". Default is CBR.
	
- export to raw DV stream "-y dvraw" (audio interleaved) or AVI-file with 
  DV video and audio on separate track in transcode's supported formats 
  (MPEG/PCM/AC3) with "-y dv".
	
- zero video frame problems with pass-through mode fixed.

- cut filter stops transcode after last cut region processing. 

- sub-command-line options for dynamic noise filter "-J dnr" added
  by Gerhard Monzel.

- fixed avilib checking 4G limit on "dev/null" thanks to a bug report
  by Gert-Jan op XP by setting frame size to 0, if no video import detected. 

- debian specific build files added.
	
--------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.1 Fri Nov 30 12:47:50 CET 2001

- minor bugfixes and some improvements.

- extended AVI-file size limit to 4GB and up to (1<<20) frames for
  convenient on file encoding.

- fixes in the avifile export module "-y af6" made by Gerhard Monzel.
  Proper DivX encoder parameter settings has been reestablished. In addition,
  a parameter file "export_af6.conf" has been added to the module 
  directory for pre-setting of other parameters supported by avifile. 
  Currently, only a few DivX codecs are supported, c.f. config file.
  Users can put a modified configuration file into "~/.transcode/", which
  will be prefered.

- new export module to support XviD Open-Source codec, which is the successor
  to OpenDivX, called "export_xvid.so", enabled with "-y xvid".
  You need to compile the codec yourself and put the binary
  file named "libxvidencore.so" in your lib search path. 
  Extended options for this codec are also available, thanks to
  extensive work by Christoph Lampert. Not tested yet.
  Visit http://www.videocoding.de for more information.

- setting keyframes at proper position in "export_af6.conf" should work now.
	
- fixed a bug in the MPEG video frame size detection. This
  bug affected proper MPEG-1 video auto-probing and more aspect ratio codes 
  for MPEG added. New file format RIFF data CDXA properly recognized.
	
- support for zero padding source files (2 byte boundaries only).
	
- more autoprobe fixes. Support for libmpeg3 unofficial framerates.

- some fine-tuning of AV sync in the demuxer.

- limited support for broken streams. Try to skip data until next 
  valid stream packet in MPEG video.
	
- small changes in the filter interface. An option string is
  supported and passed to the filter modules. This is done as follows:

  Example: -J my_filter="fonts=3 position=55 -v"

  In this example, the filter module "filter_my_filter.so" is loaded and 
  the string "fonts=3 position=55 -v" is passed as a second argument to 
  the filter routine at the initialization call. 
  Two restrictions apply: please avoid filter names containing a "=" 
  and the character "," in the options string or write a better parser.

- a subtitle filter has been added by Jan Panteltje. Untested.
  This filter is mainly for adding text subtitles from a file.
  For details, visit http://www.home.zonnet.nl/panteltje/subtitles/ 

- a frame skip filter has been added based on a suggestion by Udo Wolter.
  Use like in the following example
	-J skip="10-15 30-190"	
  to skip encoding (but decoding) of frames 10-15 and 30-190 for example.
  Note: like the -c option, frames 15 and 190 are not skipped.

- a frame selection filter has been added based on a suggestion 
  by Udo Wolter. Use like in the following example
	-J cut="10-15 30-190"	
  to encode only frames 10-15 and 30-190 for example.
  Note: like the -c option, frames 15 and 190 are not encoded.

- a filer for dynamic noise reduction of video frames has been added
  by Gerhard Monzel. Support for changing default parameter via
  filter sub-commandline will be added later. Use filter with "-J dnr".
	
- new single-pass mode "-R 3" for DivX 4.xx "-y divx4" by Gerhard Monzel. 
  This mode allows for encoding with constant quality. You need to specific
  the quantizer with the bitrate option -w. Allowed values are 1-31 with 
  decreasing quality for higher quantizer. Not tested. 
  Default setting is "-w 10" for this mode.

- enabled frame processing threads. Default was no thread, which
  was supposed to be 1.
	
- added a copy of "examples.html" to the doc directory.

- updated libmpeg2-0.2.1-cvs with latest snapshot. 
	
--------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0 Thu Nov 15 09:59:02 CET 2001

- after over 3 months and countless pre-releases, this is the official release
  of transcode-0.5.0. Cleanups and minor bugfixes since 20011109:

- the import module "import_af6.so" enabled with "-x af6" is now
  fully functional. Decode any audio/video codec and fileformat supported 
  by avifile to to any video codec provided by the avifile library.
  Currently audio export "-y af6" is restricted to transcode's audio export.
  If you want to use this module, you must supply "-x af6". 
	
- respect umask settings when creating video/audio output file.

- DVD encoder bitrate calculation done also by "tcprobe" without 
  scanning the full DVD. Information on max titles, chapters
  for selected title and viewing angles printed.
  Note: A VOB chunks with more than 1 angle can only be transcoded
  with "-x dvd". You need the *.IFO files in place.
  If you prefer the directory mode, use tccat for DVD copy, since
  only a single angle stream of your choice is extracted. 

- export_ppm.so with option "-o foo" now writes frames to foo%05d.ppm
  or falls back to frame%05d.ppm.

- support for Digital Video YUY2 codec via option "-V". Frames
  are downsampled to YV12 before processing. 
  This results in faster processing (2x), especially when de-interlaced 
  with "-I 3". Note: PAL DV decoded to YV12 by libdv, when configured 
  with "--with-pal-yuv=YV12" seems to be broken.

- fixed a bug in the AC3 pass-through mode "-A -N 0x2000" in connection with
  multiple output files setting incorrect bitrate.

- cleanup in the avilib library. Fixed a bug, where the video codec 
  information is falsely read from the stream header information, instead 
  of the bitmapinfoheader structure. The latter is required, whereas the former
  is only optional.

- fixed a bug in the import_avi.so module occuring for processing audio in 
  non-transcode produced AVI files.
	
- avicodec utility replaced by a more general new "avifix" utility.
  avifix allows to rewrite the most important AVI header information. 
  If you need to repair a truncated AVI-file, try transcode' "-P 3" 
  pass-through mode instead.

- disable compilation agianst avifile library with configure option "--with-avifile-mods=no".
	
-----------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-20011109 Fri Nov  9 12:35:47 CET 2001

- autoprobe fixes. Fixed NuppelVideo samplerate typo.
  AVI-files with Digital Video mapped to "-x dv,X", were
  X=raw for PCM, X=ac3 for AC3 and X=mp3 for MPEG audio sound track.

- fixed a bug in the audio export module, where lame changed 
  the audio samplerate without notice, leading to a mismatch
  in the AVI-file header and the encoded stream.
	
- maximum import/processing frame size is now 1024x768.

- avisplit now also accepts 0 frames AVI-files, as reported by the header,
  thanks to samples provided by Matija Grabnar.

- Digital Video import fix. Ignores invalid frame header.
  This will prevent a decoder stop but will resuse previous frame
  header information. Thanks to Henrik Wann Jensen for the sample.

- tccat now also extracts the audio stream in directory mode for AVI-files
  with option "-a".

- tcscan tries to detect codec or filetype, if option -i is provided.
  If you pipe into tcscan, you must use the codec identification.
	
- avidump utility phased out. Functionality taken over by:
          tcprobe -i f.avi                 (avidump -i f.avi)
	  tcscan -i f.avi                  (avidump -s f.avi)
          tcextract -i f.avi -t avi        (avidump -v f.avi)
	  tcextract -i f.avi -t avi -x aud (avidump -a f.avi)

- the directory "contrib" contains 2 perl scripts for automatic
  encoding of DVDs, thanks to contribution by Roland Seuhs.

- last minute export module addition by ken@hero.com.
  Use with "-y qt" and export to mjpeg/ima4 quicktime movies.
  Currently, only 24fps, 48000, 2chan, 16bit is supported.
  You need quicktime4linux installed on your system. Untested.

- minor fix in tcscan for bitrate calculation of oversize movies.
	
-----------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-20011105 Mon Nov  5 21:13:38 CET 2001

- minor autoprobe fixes. Fixed failure to detect block device,
  thanks to a report by Joern Reder. Added subtitle detection. 

- support for LPCM DVD audio sub-streams added. This
  is autodetected by default. You can force LPCM import by -n 0x10001.
  Option "-d" for byte swapping may be required.

- fixes in the new export_yuv4mpeg.so module.

- replaced read/write by p_read/p_write in avilib to fix problems 
  related to avimerging over NFS.
	
-----------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-20011103 Sat Nov  3 08:53:14 CET 2001

- most important final new feature is a user-friendly auto-probing of the 
  input source. This will make it more convenient to transcode a movie, 
  taking care of most audio and video import parameters as well as the 
  appropriate choice of the required modules. Of course, command line 
  parameter will overwrite the pre-selection

- new option "-H" to disable autoprobing of sources provided with
  "-i" and "-p".

- tcprobe finally probes the source for video and audio contents. For
  probing a DVD, you need to provide the absolute path (required by libdvdread)
  to the device/link or directory containing a DVD copy. 

- fixed a bug in the demuxer, that caused severe frame dropping after 
  approximately 1000s with option "-M 2". Thanks to a hint by Markus Sand.

- zooming with "-Z" and "-I 3" is now thread-safe, thanks to hint by
  Raphael Manfredi. This resolves some frame processing glitches on SMP
  machines.
	
- option "-n" now takes only a single argument, denoting the input
  audio format. New Option "-N" for audio export format selection.

- option "-Q" takes a second argument to choose decoding quality.
  Currently only supported by "-x dv" and libdv.

- tcframe utility phased out. Functionality taken over by new (non-AVI)
  export modules "export_ppm.so" and "export_yuv4mpeg.so".
	
- added checks for odd user provided frame parameter to avoid DivX 4.xx
  or OpenDivX encoder crash.

- added checks for odd clip parameter in Y'CbCr processing mode.
	
- added more checks for broken frames in libac3, audio is muted for pcm data
  of the frame, thanks to a bug report of Matthias Riese.

- added includes of "strings.h" to overcome compile problems, thanks to 
  a hint by Fergal Daly.

- fixed segfault when using two zooming instances with "-Z" and "-I 3",
  thanks to hint by Udo Wolter.

- enabled DVD mode for separate audio file with option "-p". Useful for
  pass-through sessions.
	
--------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-pre8 Thu Oct 25 09:58:30 CEST 2001

- last pre-release with more bugfixes, cleanups and improvements 
  for 0.5.0-final.

- established pre4 AC3 decoding core after reports of audio corruption
  problems. 

- improved demuxer modes "-M 1" (default) and "-M 2". AV synchronization
  is now locked to audio track id, rather than MPEG/AC3 audio packet.
  Option "-M 2" now drops video frames, if selected audio track is behind.
  This occurs only at the beginning of the movie and may resolve issues
  with certain PAL DVDs reported not to work with "-M 1", resulting in
  a constant AV offset. Thanks to Raphael Manfredi and Christian Worm
  for providing me with samples.

- Fix for a segfault in chapter mode "-U" and "-M 2", thanks to a hint
  by Chris C. Hoover. This was caused by a reentrance problem in clone.c.
	
- maximum import/processing frame size is now 768x576, i.e., zooming (out)
  encoded frames at 720x576 to proper aspect ration 4:3 possible. 

- new option "-X" similar to "-B", but increasing the frame size
  by a multiple of 32 rows/columns up to the maximum frame size of 768x576.
  This is useful for, e.g., resizing NTSC frames 720x480 for required 
  aspect ration 4:3 to 720x544 resolution with "-X 2". 
  Use "-Z" for better quality or more precise frame dimension requirements, 
  but this is slower. Video frame operations ordering update:
  "-j -I -X -B -Z -Y -r -z -l -k -K -G -C".	

- tcscan, in addition, dumps information on the audio AC3/MPEG tracks found in
  program streams with option "-x vob". Thanks to Julia Weissbrot for providing
  me with a sample containing only a single audio track, that had to be
  enabled with "-a 2".
	
- added an import module "import_nuv.so" for NuppelVideo contributed
  by Andreas Phlsson. You need to provide the options "-V -e 44100" 
  to make it work, as well as the proper frame size. 

- Not working yet, but added code for import module "import_af6.so" 
  to enable import of more codecs and AVI file types supported by avifile-0.6.
  Maybe this will enable ASF file format for reading.

- patch provided by Oliver Bausinger to compile against latest official avilib
  CVS snapshot avifile-0.6.0.20011018.
	
- minor transcode core improvements. Video/Audio frame processing is now
  managed by a thread pool. Default is a single thread, but can be changed with
  the second argument for option "-u". Maybe useful for SMP machines.
  Theses changes are based on suggestions by Peter Zijlstra.
	
- from pre8 on, you need liba52 installed to enable audio decoding support 
  using this library, instead of libac3, and option "-n 2001". 
  Fixed small unknown symbol bug. Status: Not working reliable yet.

- Added support for reverting a possible 3:2 pulldown of NTSC videos 
  with demuxer mode "-M 2".
  The pulldown is autodetected by checking for interlaced video frames in 
  certain MPEG sequences. The reconstruction will not always be successful, 
  due to week (=barely noticeable) interlace effects, but the AV 
  synchronization should be ok. I also changed the import of sync 
  infos produced by tcdemux to avoid program hangs on import. Still problems 
  on SMP machines reported, though.

- final changes in the clipping option "-j". Pre-processing
  frame region selection works like "-Y". with up to 4 parameter.
  If you supply less than 4, transcode default behavior is like that: 
  -j 80      is expanded to -j 80,0,80,0 (top,left,bottom,right)
  -j 80,8    is expanded to -j 80,8,80,8
  -j 80,8,10 is expanded to -j 80,8,10,8
  same applies for "-Y". Note: bottom maybe top for flipped frames.

- changes in the import/export API. Modules are able to provide limited
  information on frame attributes. Useful and applied to pass-through mode,
  where key-frame information got is now passed to the export module and
  avilib.

- fixed the "last chapter missing" bug in tccat.

- added interlace option mode "-I 3", where the frame field is expanded
  with the internal high-quality zooming. This is slow, but may
  give better results.

- changes in the filter API: Take at look at the examples. Added an "init" and 
  "close" call for convenience.
	
- added test filter "filter_32detect.so", which actually only tries to
  detect interlaced video frames. Just to play around.

- added YUY2->YV12 converter filter "filter_yuy2toyv12.so". 

- added deinterlace filter "filter_dilyuvmmx.so" for YV12 and MMX,
  code ported from the DScaler Project by the xine project.

- anti-alias option for Y'CbCr colorspace frame processing enabled.
  Not yet tested.

- some minor changes in the frame buffer core. Static video buffer
  is now aligned at page boundaries.
	
- included libdvdread library updated to v0.9.2.
	
- OpenDivX module forced to include proper encore2.h.

- minor small bug fixed in clipping routines.

- small bug in avilib fixed, thanks to patch by Sergei Golubchik.
	
- renamed pread/pwrite to avoid name conflicts with system routines.

- display of correct video frame aspect ratio on status info messages. 
	
--------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-pre7 Wed Oct 10 13:56:02 CEST 2001	

- more bugfixes and cleanups for 0.5.0-final:

- the OpenDivX memory leak was tracked down thanks to Martin Miels who
  also provided a fix. As suspected, the bug was in the encoder core.

- the fast resizing with option "-B" has been improved in speed by 
  switching to integer arithmetic, thanks to a patch by Carsten Geckeler.

- improved gamma correction (option "-G") implemented by Carsten Geckeler
  for Y'CbCr and RGB colorspace. Try to stay between 0.5 and 2.0.
	
- changes in the export section to make transcode work with the latest
  avifile-0.6.0.20011003 CVS snapshot, thanks to patches submitted
  by Oliver Bausinger and Kurt Huwig. The snapshot contains some 
  annoying debugging code. You might want to comment out lines 227 and 234
  in file avifile-0.6.0.20011003/plugins/libwin32/videocodec/VideoEncoder.cpp.

- fixed a dump bug in the Cr/Cb swap routine for option "-k".

- import module "import_yuv4mpeg.so" now supports "-V" turbo and "-i" directory mode.

- changes in the frame drop/clone decision alogorithm "-M 2" to prevent 
  small amplitude fluctuations of +1/-1 frames to be corrected. 
  Some people reported jerky playback.

- the included libdvdread has been renamed to avoid linking against a
  locally installed version of libdvdread.

- DVD chapter mode encoding (option "-U") possible running out of audio samples
  at the end fixed.

- new option "-O" to change MPEG audio encoding internal cleanup. 
  This option enables lame >=3.89 to flush the internal mp3 buffer
  when the AVI file, not the encoder, is closed. In addition, these mp3 
  frames are appended to the last audio "frame" of the interleaved AVI file. 
  Do not use this option unless you think you really need it or you do not
  want to "avimerge" your encoded DVD chapters.

- import module "import_mp3.so" now supports audio extraction from AVI-files.
	
--------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-pre6 Tue Oct  2 12:55:25 CEST 2001

- this pre-release fixes couple of bugs and reorganizes the configure script:

- all previously marked as "experimental" features are now enabled by default. 
  You need to explicitly disable them, if you encounter problems. 
  The configure script now tries to detect and use a local installation 
  of lame. If it fails, the included "libmp3lame" based on version 3.87 is 
  used. If you cannot get trancode to compile with your avifile installation,
  use "--with-avifile-mods=no" to disable build of "export_af6.so".
  avifile-0.53 is considered to be obsolete, but can be enabled with 
  "--enable-avifile6=no".
	
- import_dvd.so: 
  A wrong assumption on the layout of DVDs has lead to 
  incomplete extraction of DVD chapters with "-x dvd". Most
  DVDs work, e.g., "The Matrix" (PAL) did not. This bug was fixed.
  I also reintroduced a finite time delay (3 secs) between access to the 
  DVD device for audio and video stream extraction. 

- export_af6.so:  
  Now works with the latest avifile-0.6.0.20010928 snapshot,
  thanks to a patch by Oliver Bausinger.

- a small bug for odd frame parameter disabled frame processing. Fixed,
  but most encoders do not work with odd frame width or height anyway.
	
- broken directory mode "-i" fixed with a patch by Harm van der Heijden.

- the audio encoder wrongly flushed the buffer with mp3-frames and 
  transcode options "-U" or "-t" and lame 3.89  enabled when the files are 
  closed. Reestablished pre4 behavior.
	
- a small bug in clone_clode(), leading to segfaults on ^C in connection 
  with "-M2" has been fixed.
	
- hidden debug mode "-q 128" for interested users prints out some 
  information on the synchronization process with option "-M 2":
  
  Displayed are:
  (1) total stream frame number (as encoded in the stream) 
  (2) current MPEG sequence number
  (3) total number of frames dropped (<0) or cloned (>0) so far
  (4) current AV sync delay with respect to provided "-f" frame rate
  (5) current PTS based frame rate / provided fps ratio  
  (6) current MPEG sequence header PTS 

  What can you expect: 
  If your provided frame rate "-f" is OK, the calculated fps ratio (5)
  should go to 1 and the total number of frames dropped/cloned should stay 
  constant at some point. The AV sync delay will always be close to 0, 
  if the algorithm can adjust within its given limits, e.g., a sequence
  can only drop every second frame. Play around by varying "-f".
  You will find that PAL program streams are "encoded" at a constant
  frame display time of 0.04 seconds, correspoding to 25 fps.
  Note for NTSC "users": In order to obtain relaiable results, decode well 
  into the actal movie, since trailer and list of cast may be encoded
  at different speeds. Example: "Highlander I".

- new option "-G" for a gamma correction in RGB based video frames.
	
--------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-pre5 Fri Sep 28 13:44:09 CEST 2001	

- this pre-release is mainly intended for interested users. It adds more 
  missing features and changes in the default behavior of transcode
  that have to make it into 0.5.0-final. Not perfect and well tested yet, 
  but mostly usable. Maybe one more pre-release to come.

- change in the order of how video frame operations are applied:
  It's  "-j -I -B -Z -Y -r -z -l -k -K -C". 
  All operations are displayed with a short status information. 
  For the new "-Y" option, s. below.

- if you want to try out the latest libmpeg2-0.2.1 CVS snapshot 2001/09/26,
  configure with "--enable-libmpeg2cvs".

- change in the default behavior of the "-S" option. 
  All units beginning with 0 are processed by default if no
  "-S" option is provided.
  If you provide a unit argument "-S N", processing starts at this
  unit N until the end of the stream.
  If you provide additional sequence arguments "-S N,s1-s2, only this 
  selected chunk is processed.
  This option is passed directly to "tcdemux"
	
- new option "-M mode" that controls the processing of program
  streams handled by "tcdemux". 

  mode=0: pass-through, do not mess with the stream, switch off
	  any synchronization/demuxing process. 
  mode=1: (default mode) Synchronize video and audio by inspecting
	  PTS/DTS time stamps of audio and video and dump to stdout
	  depending on the selected payload.
	  Preferred mode for PAL VOB streams and DVDs.
  mode=2: new very experimental (=alpha) NTSC VOB stream synchronization 
	  feature. This mode generates synchronization information for 
	  transcode by analyzing the frame display time. As a result, 
	  a strict frame rate will be enforced, which matches the audio and
	  has to be provided by the user with option "-f".
	  Do not expect this mode to work!!!!! Use chapter mode for DVD's
	  for testing. Occasional encoding lock-ups still have to be resolved. 

  Currently, only import_vob.c and import_dvd.c support this option,
  which is passed directly to "tcdemux".
	
- support for MP3 decoding has been added. However, you need to have
  the newest lame-3.89 library installed on your system. Enable linking
  against lame-3.89, instead of the included version, with "--enable-lame89"
  and provide the prefix to the directory tree of the installed library and 
  include files. I will eventually switch to lame-3.89 as a completely 
  external library. 
  The "-n" option changed and now takes 2 arguments. The first denotes 
  the codec of the audio track or stream. The second argument will be the 
  codec of the audio of the encoded movie, if transcode supports it.
  Enable MP(123)->PCM->MP3 re-encoding with the following two argument 
  "-n 0x55,0x55" which allows audio frame processing before re-encoding to MP3.
  Use "tscan" for program streams to obtain information about available audio 
  tracks. No pass-through for MPEG audio yet. The default is "-n 0x2000,0x55" 
  for AC3->MP3. A new import module "import_mp3.so" was added to decode
  raw MP3 audio stream. For program streams, use "-x dvd" or "-x vob", which
  are updated to support MP3.
	
- new video frame clip option "-Y". This option enables post-processing
  clipping of frames and takes up to 4 arguments. 
  For Example, "-Y 80,100,10,40" cuts 80 pixel rows from the top, 
  100 columns from the left, 10 rows from the bottom and 40 columns from the 
  right of your frame. This clipping is the final video frame operation
  and enables cutting out an arbitrary region of the frame.

- fault tolerant AC3 decoding, thanks to a patch by Vaclav Slavik, who
  updated the libac3 related stuff. This should prevent transcode crashing  
  on broken AC3 frames. I also changed the extraction routine for AC3 
  streams to support non-strict MPEG format.	

- experimental support for liba52, a free ATSC A/52 stream decoder, successor 
  to libac3 and ac3dec. Enable decoding (pseudo format id 0x2001) and 
  encoding to MP3 with "-n 0x2001,0x55".

- improved support for MPEG-1 video streams. Most streams can be transcoded
  with import modules "-x (vob mpeg2 mpeg3)".
	
- new universal frontend for extraction only with the utility "tccat".
  The utility extracts chapters from DVD's, concatenates VOB/DV/raw-stream 
  chunks from a directory, extracts and concatenates video from a directory 
  containing AVI files, and more to come. Replaced "cat" and "ls"
  commands with system library call in the directory mode. DVD chapter
  extraction with option "-T" now handled by "tccat".

- reorganized source preparation for import and updated import modules:
	
  tccat - tcdemux - tcextract - tcdecode
  |       |         |           |
  ^extraction of multiplexed streams from filesystem/device
	  |         |           |
	  ^synchronize stream and separate video/audio packets
	            |           |
		    ^extract elementary stream from packets/container-file
		                |
				^decode into suitable raw format for processing

- bugfix in the audio encoder to enable processing of mono streams 
  (lame-3.89 only).
	
--------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-pre4 Wed Sep 12 12:00:00 CEST 2001

- this pre-release contains some new features and new options:

- "tcdemux" rewritten and improved. It now features a more advanced 
  audio/video synchronization processing core for MPEG2 program streams.
	
- new option "-S" to navigate somehow in a program stream. In combination with
  "-x vob", this option allows to seek and process a single presentation unit. 
  A new presentation unit is defined by a reset of the 
  PTS (presentation time stamp) in the packet header. A second, optional 
  argument (s1-s2) lets you seek to the beginning of a package containing 
  MPEG sequence header s1 and process the stream until MPEG sequence header s2.
  This option and arguments are passed directly to "tcextract/tcdemux".
  The default is unit 0 and all sequences within a unit. Use "tcscan"
  see below for more information on your VOB stream before you use this
  option, since "tcdemux" may seek forever. Useful if (1) you cannot use 
  DVD navigation with "-x dvd", or (2) need to cut a chunk out of a 
  VOB stream, or (3) if you have an NTSC video with some non-audio or junk 
  units prepended to the main presentation unit, which prevents basic 
  synchronization of audio and video.

- "tcscan" accepts pseudo codec "-x vob" to scan a program stream for 
  presentation units and MPEG sequences.

- new option "-Z" for arbitrary high-quality frame resizing, i.e., zooming.
  This patch is contributed by Vaclav Slavik, who ported the original
  code of Ray Gardener, Daylon Graphics Ltd, from Graphics Gems III, adapted 
  and optimized for use in transcode. 

- a bug, that affected audio encoding with non-PAL frame rates was fixed, 
  thanks to a hint by Markus Sand.

- new option "-E" for down-sampling the audio rate for export, provided
  by Vaclav Slavik. Down-sampling is done with "lame".

- upgraded to "libdvdread-0.9.0". This version also uses "libdvdcss"
  in replacement of "libcss" to access an encrypted DVD. 
  This fixes some problems with DVD images. Option "-i" should now
  also work with a directory/mountpoint for DVD navigation with "-x dvd".
  Take care to provide an absolute path in this case. 

- a bug in "tcscan", where audio packets were wrongly scanned for MPEG 
  video sequence headers was fixed.

- a progress meter for option "-c" was added by Vaclav Slavik.
	
--------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-pre3 Wed Aug 22 12:00:00 CEST 2001

- this pre-release fixes a few bugs and addresses the import section:

- reduced transcode's default encoder bitrate to 1800 kbps, since
  avifile 0.6 and DivX 4.0/OpenDivX now pay more attention to provided values.

- new utility "avisplit". It tries to split large AVI-files at keyframe
  boundaries into approximte chunks of your choice of size. It currently 
  only works as intended for DivX 4.0/OpenDivX or raw AVI files.

- new video only import module "import_mpeg3.so", based on 
  libmpeg3. You need to have libmpeg3 installed or provide
  a path to the library and include files. Enable/disable build of the module
  with configure option "--with-libmpeg3", which is the default. Not
  tested much yet but is meant to be an interface to all file formats
  supported by libmpeg3. Audio decoding to be done.
	
- transcode/tcextract now accept DVD chapter value "-1", which means that
  the DVD is treated as a single huge program stream (VOB) chunk. This
  makes some more transcode options, e.g. "-c" or "-t", work for DVDs.

- tcscan estimates the optimum encoder bitrate after a PCM scan of the source
  with option "-x pcm" for a 1-2 CD burn. The bitrate calculator can also be
  called directly with option "-w X", with the number of frames of the movie
  and "-b" for the MP3 audio bitrate. 

- obsolete modules "cat", "yuv" and "mpeg3cat" removed. Functionality of 
  import module import_yuv.so now included in "import_raw.so".

- fixed a bug that disabled RGB output of import_mpeg2.so".

- fixed a segfault for "-R 2" in cases where the (pass-1) logfile is not found.
	
--------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-pre2 Fri Aug 17 12:00:00 CEST 2001

- this pre-release addresses the export section and speed improvements:

- experimental "avifile-0.6" support added. Configure with "--enable-avifile6".
  The corresponding new export module is "export_af6.so", use option
  "-y af6" and optionally "-F STRING", where STRING is a valid avifile
  codec string. Default is "DivX ;-) low-motion".
	
- Y'CbCr color space support expanded. Most important frame processing 
  operations do accept YV12 internal codec enabled with option 
  "-V". This will boost encoding speed up to 30%!!! depending on the
  frame operations applied.

- 2-pass encoding option "-R" flags 1+2 enabled for DivX 4.0 Beta "-y divx4".
  Two-pass-code from OpenDivX ported by Christoph Lampert.
  Not yet tested but working. 
  
- changes in the export API. The initialization of the
  encoder is done only once. The "open" and "close" routines
  are called, if a new AVI output file is needed, 
  enclosing the encoder core loop. This is much cleaner, but breaks 
  the obsolete export_divx2.so. This may also fix a memory leak in the 
  OpenDivX export module.

- export module "divx2" has been phased out, use "divx" instead.

- export module "iv50" updated and enabled multiple audio output option.
	
- option "-w" now accepts crispness 0-100 as a third video encoder argument.

- the quality option -Q x (x=1-5) is translated to x*2000 for
  the old Divx;-) dll codec in "-y divx".

- introducing limited support for a filter-plugin facility with option "-J".
  see /filter/filter_null.c for more hints how to use and write
  your own plugin for video/audio raw data manipulation.
  Currently, frame manipulations are not allowed to change the frame size.
	
--------------------------------------------------
transcode-0.5.0-pre1 Fri Aug 10 12:00:00 CEST 2001
	
- encoding using DivX 4.0 Beta enabled with new the export module
  "export_divx4.so". Currently, only single-pass encoding is available.
  Use the new option "-Q x", with x=(1=fastest-5=best) for quality
  setting.
  Note: transcode dynamically loads the codec file "libdivxencore.so".
	This file must either be located in the MOD_PATH directory
	or in your default library search path. 

- multi-pass encoding for "-y divx4" will be added later.  

---------------------------------------------
transcode-0.4.2 Thu Aug  9 10:53:50 CEST 2001

- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Note: this release contains the unofficial pre-release of v0.5.0 
  experimental major feature enhancements;-). Use at your own risk!
  If you want to try it out, use configure with "--enable-dvdread" option.
  You also need "libcss-0.1.0" (not included) as a dynamical library 
  installed in your default library search path to enable usage of the new 
  import_dvd.so module "-x dvd" and to extract or transcode a single 
  encrypted DVD on-the-fly with the included new libdvdread library.

  !!However, transcoding of complete DVDs is not yet tested very well. 
  It may smoke your DVD drive and I do not take any responsibility!!
  
  New option "-T" to enable transcoding of a single chapter of a
  selected DVD title stream, and selection of a specific viewing angle,
  if the DVD is mastered with a multi-angle feature. 
  
  New option "-U" for encoding a full DVD title, each chapter into a separate 
  file. 

  Option "-i" needs the !!full absolute path to your DVD block device!!,
  the mountpoint will not work correctly with libdvdread v0.8.0! 
  This will, hopefully, be fixed in v0.5.0.
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	
- added more audio export options to export_opendivx.so and export_raw.so 
  modules. "divx", "raw" and "opendivx" now share a common audio encoding 
  interface with PCM->MPEG, PCM->PCM and AC3->AC3.

- single VOB chunk encoding no longer suffers from audio/video sync problems,
  which makes option "-D" obsolete.

- DV-NTSC encoding frame size bug fixed and much faster de-interlacing. 

- rewrite of import_avi.so module. Import of interleaved AVI files with
  any audio/video codec for new pass-through option "-P" enabled.
	
- transcode will now pass-through any unsupported compressed audio/video 
  frames from AVI files with new experimental option "-P" and import 
  module import_avi.so. This allows for audio "-P 2" or video "-P 1" only
  transcoding with export module export_raw.so. Using "-P 3" should 
  simply copy your input AVI file.

- new helper tool "tcdemux". Currently it can only handle program streams.
  Video and audio program stream packets can be filtered out. Options "-o O"
  and "-s num" seeks to packets with video payload and 
  sequence start code num and pipes the remaining of the VOB chunk to stdout.
  tcdemux will eventually split audio and video contents of a multiplexed 
  input stream and send the output streams to a socket pair or named pipes for 
  remote transcoding.
	
- tcscan now analyses MPEG video stream for sequence header information
  with option "-x mpeg2".

- transcode verbosity flag is passed on to tcextract, tcdecode, ... 
  No more annoying error messages at the end of import streams. Use "-q 2" 
  debug mode first, if you have any problems transcoding.
	
- bugfix audio import that affected modules not doing the actual reading
  of the byte stream.

- import of AC3 audio also possible with "-x vob" and "-x dvd".
	
- enabled writing audio to separate files with option "-m".

- transcode core changes, to enable DVD chapter mode.
	 
---------------------------------------------
transcode-0.4.1 Sat Jul 28 19:11:51 CEST 2001

- this is only a bugfix release, no new features.

- export_divx.cpp now initializes lame encoder only at the very first call 
  and keeps it  open because avifile drops a few mp3 frames on closing 
  the encoder at the end.  This should solve audio/video sync problems 
  for encoding split to smaller AVI files with option "-t". A cleaner
  fix is scheduled for v0.4.2. 
	
- a bug (race condition) in the decoder thread was fixed, that affected the
  seeking option "-c", or in rare instances, encoding on ultra fast machines.

- a bug in export_divx.cpp was fixed related to the output to "/dev/null".
	
- minor changes related to the extraction of AC3 streams. Import aborted if
  no AC3 sync frame found within 1 MB stream data. 

- default audio codec id for MPEG is now layer-3, 0x55.
	
- minor cleanups in the tools directory.

- tcscan now also has a frame rate option "-f".
	
---------------------------------------------
transcode-0.4.0 Mon Jul 23 11:26:15 CEST 2001

- transcode now accepts a directory name as input file (option -i)
  containing, e.g., the chunks of a ripped DVD. The VOB streams are
  concatenated for processing, thus appearing as a single
  stream - this way, almost perfect audio/video synchronization is achieved.

- new option -B to enable resizing and changing the aspect ratio
  of the encoded frame. Some restrictions apply, e.g. reduction only by 
  integral values of 32 rows/cols possible. Good for anamorphic DVDs.
  Example with PAL input: "-j 80,8 -B 3,0" yields 704x320 frame size
  and an aspect ratio of 2.20:1

- new option -A to enable pass-through of AC3 audio frames.
  Use "-x mpeg2,ac3 -y divx -A -n 0x2000" to transcode to DivX;-) 
  AVI files with AC3 sound. No encoding or processing yet, your source 
  must already be AC3. Works with mplayer and Windows Mediaplayer. 

- bugfix: outdated code in the libvo removed that prevented users from
  processing non-PAL VOB streams. Thanks to Udo Wolter for giving me the hint.

- bugfix: counter shows 0 fps for option -t from second file on,
  bug introduced in v0.3.3-pre3.
	
- new option -I enables de-interlacing of video frames (simple bob),
  most useful for full screen processing of Digital Video.

- new option -C enables anti-aliasing of video frame.
      mode=1: only rows are processed, that have been altered by
      previous frame operations.
      mode=2: full frame anti-aliasing (slow).
	
- note: turning on the debug mode "-q 2" produces white dots
  where anti-aliasing "-C" has altered the original frame. 

- new option -K for removing color of video frame (b/w mode), useful
  for previews and who knows what.
	
- new option -V to enable pass-through of YUV (YV12) video frames.
  Currently, only export_raw.so exports to uncompressed AVI files for xanim.

- new tool "tcscan" replaces pcmscan. Does some simple
  audio stream checks (ac3/pcm).	

- tcextract converts AC3 stream with padding bytes or junk between frames 
  as extracted, e.g., from VOB files to a clean connected sequence of AC3 
  frames: "tcextract -i file.VOB -x ac3 | tcextract -x ac3"
	
- some cleanups in the configure script. Added "-lm" for SuSe et al. users.

- small changes in the API for import/export
  (1) transcode now respects amount of bytes read per frame in input modules. 
      Useful for AC3/YUV frames.
  (2) transcode tries to query import/export capability flag. For useful
      values s. tc_defaults.h
  Changes in vob_t structure, external modules need to be recompiled. 
	
---------------------------------------------
transcode-0.3.2 Tue Jul 10 22:54:08 CEST 2001

- new option -D to synchronize audio and video. A positive number N means
  start at audio frame N for video frame 0. A negative number inserts
  |N| silent audio frames at the start of the movie. 

- new tool "avisync" tries to sync the already finished AVI file similar
  to the -D option of transcode by shifting audio and video by N frames. 
  N>0 works but most player ignore 0 byte audio frames. This can be improved
  later.

- added a transcode.spec file kindly provided by Volker Moell <moell@gmx.de>. 
  This is certainly useful for building custom RPMs. Some binary RPMs are now
  available which only need the "avifile-0.53.*" library installed
  to get the DivX;-) export modules working.
	
---------------------------------------------
transcode-0.3.1 Sun Jul  8 22:33:55 CEST 2001

- fixed error messages in tcdecode that slipped into the raw streams. 
  This broke, e.g., the pcmscan tool. 

- reading from a FIFO with option (-i) should now work, except for DV and
  AVI files which use lseek in low level routines.
	
- more warnings issued if codec options (-x/-y) or filename options (-i,-o) 
  are missing in the command line.

- added output raw stream codec option -y for tcdecode. For example,
  tcdecode -x dv -y (rgb,yv12,pcm) decodes raw DV frames into
  raw RGB,YV12 (video) or PCM (audio) stream.

- Digital Video now handled by tcdecode and tcextract. No more patching
  of libdv required. You still need libdv installed on your system.
  However, sound extraction in libdv seems to be broken. Use "-x dv,raw"
  if you have an AVI file containing the DV frames.

- tcframe now transforms YUV raw stream into YUV4MPEG stream (stdout) 
  for viewing stream with, e.g., "yuvplay".

- renamed: libvoppm -> libvo and libvoppm.a -> libvout.a
  added yuv output option in libvo. 

- added Intel Indeo 5 export module FourCC=IV50, but avifile support
  seems to be broken.
	
- some changes in the configure.in script for libdv and lame.
	
---------------------------------------------
transcode-0.3.0 Tue Jul  3 12:48:46 CEST 2001

- (1) import feature enhancements:
	
- package now includes ac3dec (0.6.1), mpeg2dec (0.2.0), lame (3.87),
  no more patches for MPEG VOB files / unencrypted DVD's required.

- new import modules (some with overlapping functionality with older modules) 
	"vob"        MPEG2/AC3 program stream only (*.VOB)
  	"yuv"        reads raw yuv (YV12) video stream and converts it to raw RGB
	"yuv4mpeg"   mjpeg-tools yuv video stream format / wav pcm audio 
	             (not tested very well)
	"raw"        raw rgb/pcm from RIFF AVI/WAVE files, or raw streams with
	             autodetect feature provided by "tcextract" s. below.
		     (combines functionality of "cat" and "avi" modules,
                      s. also transcode homepage for module description) 
	"null"       dummy module, if no audio stream will be processed.
	
- new helper programs for easy building/debugging of new import modules:

	"tcextract" handy extractor frontend transcode, extracts from different
	 file formats and stdin, output goes to stdout

	"tcdecode" handy decoder frontend for transcode, decodes raw stream 
         from file or stdin into rgb stream for stdout 
        
	"tcframe" reads raw rgb stream from file or stdin and produces a 
	 sequence of ppm files for debugging or still images.

- some old import modules switched to use included "tcextract" and "tcdecode"
  binaries. Minor updates.
	
- added "avicodec" in tools subdirectory to change video/audio codec 
  in header of AVI files

- (2) transcode core bugfixes/changes:

- fixed encoder segfault on import close on instances 
  with no valid first frame

- fixed race condition with import thread on exit where encoder was not
  properly closed	

- transcode now uses "-i /dev/zero -x null -o /dev/null -y null" as defaults
  if no input/output files or codecs are provided. 	
	
- (3) export feature enhancements: none, minor code cleanup.

- changes in the configure file for auto-detection of MMX, ...
	
---------------------------------------------
transcode-0.2.2 Thu Jun 21 22:46:25 CEST 2001

- divxbitrate problem solved for export_divx.so	

- feature enhancements:
   -cut columns in frame at left and right side with option -j                
   -mirror image of frame with new option -l
   -add keyframe interval parameter with option -w

- added "avimerge" in tools subdirectory: works with mplayer
  but aviplay "clicks" at movie transition	
	
- more video processing infos displayed
	
- added static frame buffers for import thread (configure with --statbuffer) 
  to avoid alloc/free cycles. 

- changes in the video/audio processing core module. All video/audio
  transformations are performed on actual frame buffer

- _vob_t structure changes -- external modules need to be recompiled!	

- minor language cleanups	

---------------------------------------------	
transcode-0.2.1 Sun Jun 17 19:55:39 CEST 2001

- added mp3bitrate, proper audiocodec and interleaved flag in avilib.c.
  videos produced by export_divx.so now playable by "aviplay"
  and "mplayer". 	

- fixed AVI file corruption bug in dl_loader.c, where program
  aborted on input stream error rather than performing proper cleanup

- removed required output file if -t option is given

- moved encoder init and stop calls from transcode.c to encoder.c

- added pcmscan and vobscan.sh in tools subdirectory to
  estimate the maximum volume increase for audio stream, in case
  you do not have "sox"	.

- fix for segfault on mp3bitrate < 192 kbs in export_divx2.so

---------------------------------------------	
transcode-0.2.0 Thu Jun 14 00:05:04 CEST 2001

- initial public release
